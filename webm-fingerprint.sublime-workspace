The new CEO has proved that she does not stand by the same ideas and cannot be trusted to run the platform.\nEllen Pao is ruining reddit. If she doesn't step down, I will be moving to voat.co like so many other longtime redditors.\nEllen Pao doesn't know shit about running companies.\nI'm signing because I believe that Ellen Pao does not have the fidelity and correct character to be in charge of a website based on the contribution of its users. With Ellen in charge there has been frequent occasions of ignorance towards the userbase, which is what makes this site what is is and what it shall continue to be, with or without Ellen Pao.\nThe internet is about freedom. Political correctness is incorrect. Censorship of any kind is to be fought against. Pau must go!\nSomething has to change.\nEllen Pao has demostrated she is incompetent at her job. She has demostrated a failure to communicate with the community she is in charge of,  and has a history of unethical activities. Please remove her. While you are at it, remove kn0thing as well. His a fucking retard.\nEllen Pao has ruined my favourite website...FILTHY DIRTY WHORE\nEllen Pao makes the wrong decisions\nThis woman is like a bull in a China shop\nDoes not understand the needs of the community and the people that support it. Sees reddit as a business, where it should be treated as a baby and nurtured to grow naturally. Her recent speakings are evidence of her inability to comprehend the communities needs and saying that most of them do not care. \nReally, you have to ask?\ni wanna see dat asian ass on y computer screen\nfuck that megalomaniacal cunt \nEllen Pao  ran over my dog!\nFuck that BITCH \nIt's disgusting how poorly qualified the head of a major media company is to run said company.\nThat aint cool yo\nShe is obviously very disconnected from her userbase and does not seem fit for the job\nI want my reddit back\nEllen Pao is CRAZY.\nI do not agree or care whether Ms Pao is \" a manipulative individual who will sue her way to the top\", however she should not have sacked a member of the Reddit team in such an abrupt way. \n\nThe response form both Ms Pao and a co founder of Reddit shows how out of touch they are form how Reddit works. \n\nTo say that people are still using Reddit is correct, but something as big as Reddit ( or the Roman Empire or Blackberry ) dose not die in a day. It is a long drawn out process. \nShe's a fucking disaster for an once open minded site where you could enjoy whatever keeps you happy.\nCensorship like she suggests will ruin reddit. It's not a safe space, it's a forum for discussion. If reddit is censored, open discussion will be pushed back into anonymous sites and the dark web.\nChancellor Pao must be stopped! It's a trap!\nEllen Pao has done nothing but degrade Reddit to a shell of its former self.\nChange is needed. Pao stepping down will probably not do the trick\nToo many reasons\nSo strange to see her attempt to make reddit like china. \nSomeone must go!\nfuck you\nI want to see reddit how it was before \nI want Reddit given back to the users rather than a corporation.\nI'm signing because I usually lurk reddit and all this talk about how bad Ellen Pao is, is getting in the way of my lurking. Prefer she not be there.\nReddit isn't just important to it's many users, it's an important tool for humanity to curate knowledge. \n\nA company like this deserves a leader who's vision is inline with the sites potential. Ellen Pao has clearly demonstrated that she does not share the same vision or integrity with the users or staff who bond the site together. \n\nThe socially responsible thing to is for her to step down and find her niche elsewhere... \nReddit\nReddit is a fantastic community and seeing it fall at the hands of Pao would be criminal. \n卐 Ellen Pao 卐\nOVERTHROW CHAIRMAN PAO!\nash\nBecause she is bad for company\nThis was a very bad PR. I hope to see some changes and fast. And a very detailed apology for the fired employee. \nellen pao is dissapointing\nEllen Pao is destroying Reddit :(\nthis woman is pure trash and will ruin Reddit\nBecause fuck Ellen pao \nREDDIT NEEDS CHANGE. A good change this time...\nIm signing this to make sure the reddit community has a great ceo and not a nazi ceo\nShe is worse than Hitler and Comcast having an illegitimate spawnchild.\nDon't want reddit to die\nIt's important that reddit remains a website where freedom of speech isn't hindered in anyway.\nSu Kyi cannot be let free holding the most important thing in the internet.\nIve watched reddit change from something I once loved into something else entirely.\ncensorship is un\nReddit is on its way down, voat.co, let's go!\nThis bitch cray\nEllen Pao is not fit to be a CEO of this company.  Her interests do not suit the interests of others.\nReddit deserves someone awesome and needs someone who the user base supports. That person is not Ellen Pao\nPao represents everything that is against what Reddit stands for.\nStop Ellen Pao from destroying the Reddit.com community by making her step down as CEO of Reddit Inc.\nFor a better reddit \nellen pao needs to step down. \nUp its and downvote is the system.. This CEO doesn't understand reddit... You count not have made a worse choice\nGood intentions, poor executions... she is not doing a good job leading Reddit.\nshe is a terrible choice as a CEO and is destroying reddit\nShe does not seem like a good CEO\ncause this lady screwed over the best site on the internet\nFreedom of information.\nEllen Pao consistently ignores the needs of the Reddit community and does not have enough skill or expertise to act as a competent CEO, as has been shown by her actions.\ni am part of the silent majority, and this person isn't helping the site i love\nEllen pal is completely disillusioned and is driving her company into the ground. \nI do not support any changes made by Ellen Pao and believe things will only get worse under her regime.\ni dont like the way reddit is developing\nReddit is a great community and she does not believe in our speech.\nReddit is in danger and Pao is not the person for the job\nthis woman is dooming reddit.\nI'm a sheep\nReddit was the last bastion for free speech on the Internet. Recently, the actions caused by Ms. Pao has resulted in a change of how myself and others view the website. No longer does the site protect basic freedoms, it has become a mess of censorship and a shell of its former self. Please find a CEO who understands the website for what it once stood for and stop with the mindless censorship. \nShe's awful\nbitch is a cunt\nThis woman is not fit to be a CEO. I would not hire her to mow my lawn. \nI don't like Reddit's direction, and I don't like the leadership who are there because they sued their way to the top.\ni want change\nReddit told me too\nShe is a horrible CEO A\nI'm signing because removing Ellen Pao as CEO is an absolute necessity in order to save Reddit from complete self destruction. \nPao needs to resign and go back to wherever she crawled out of.\nIf Reddit continues to face the censorship it has recently undergone other similar websites will grow following the exodus of the users who made Reddit great.\nShe is an idiot\nfreedom of speech is an all or nothing ordeal.\nI do not like Pao\nShe needs to step down, right, now. \nShe's a bitch.\ncensorship ,free speech\nEveryone else is...  \nFUCK PAO\nI am concerned for reddit.\nI'm signing because I fear that Reddit will no longer be the site I cherish and love.\nWhen you cut out a man's tongue you merely say you fear what he might say  and you give it power\nellen pao has a chin like Stan Smith from American Dad\nI'm signing because fuck you, Pao\nPao has no place as the CEO of reddit. There is far too much if a disconnect between users and executives.\nSomething needs to change.\nEllen Pao is destroying reddit\ni dont like chairman pao\nshes ruining the site\nIf we don't speak out against injustices, we will be doomed to being taken for granted. \n\nWhat separates the US from Syria is freedom of speech. Let's keep it that way.\nStep down from CEO.\nReddit is not giving enough credits to some of it's admins.\nPoor management.\nEllen Pao is a fucking tyrant.\nEllen is a fool.\nReddit is more than just a link aggregator, it's a home to thousands of dedicated communities. The direction of the administration neglects communities in favour of self-righteous politicising driving people away in droves and ultimately damaging those communities that make Reddit what it is.\n\nThe CEO since joining has added no value and instead has been instrumental in bad policy decisions and implementations that makes it a worse place to visit.\nI disagree with the business and ethical tactics she employs.\nReddit has lost it's authenticity for freethinking and having an open mind. How can r/theredpill and r/watchpeopledie exist with tons of subscribers but r/fatpeoplehate gets shut down because of Pao's personal reasons. That's a dictatorship. Step down Pao. \nShe is not worthy to lead.\nBecause Ellen Pao has only created disruption and bad days on Reddit. I'm sick of seeing the front page filled with Reddit drama because of this Queen Of Drama and her dumb shit.\nno leader should create this much controversy either male or female.\nEllen Pao is the scourge of Reddit and must be purged. \nalthough I haven't been using reddit long, it doesn't take much to realize the problem here. Anyone using Reddit daily knows what she's doing to it. RUINING IT \nCause she's a POS\nI'm signing because the Internet needs freedom of speech!\nDisconnect between Pao and society. \nReddit was at its best when it embodied free speech. Now I fear its best days are behind it, unless Pao steps down. \nLatest developments\nSHE TOOK DOWN FPH\nI \nBitch is horrible!\nayyylomomommomomo\nI want reddit to be good again\nEllen Pao has no connection with the users of Reddit.\nBecause Ellen is a fuck wit and keeps changing and removing people and things that shouldn't be messed with. \nI fear she will destroy my favorite website. She is completely out of touch with redditors.\nI'm user of Reddit\nI liked the old reddit, why ruin freedom of speach on the internet?\nFree speech over corporate interests.\nI don't like the way reddit is heading to. I want ama back on full force and \n\nI really liked the freedom of speech the site had.\nI enjoyed reddit and its community for years, however under Ellen's regime the site has taken a number of steps that I feel are against the underlying history and principles that made reddit so good in the past. She is toxic, dangerousness, unskilled, inexperienced, and out of touch with the user base.\ni love reddit\nI'm signing because freedom is speech is a right, not a privilege \nCreated for an open voice for all without influence from commercialization.\nI'm signing because I hate censorship. The internet is suppose to be free and Reddit is a community based site and the community should run itself...democracy!\nLack of communication\nShe needs to step down.\nUnder Ellens leaderships reddit has gone off into a different direction \nCensorship of Reddit is unfair and has no base.\nWe need someone better\nthe quality of this website (freedom of speech, variety of content however offensive, etc) has come drastically down since Ellen Pao has become the CEO. \nI like being on reddit and i believe in free speech. \ni love the website and it's being ruined by Pao\nI hate Ellen Pao and all SJW faggots!!!\nI joined Reddit for its freedom of expression. You are destroying that, and harming the community as a whole\nEllen pao is ruinning the reddit experience for me.\nChaiman Pao, step down. We've had enough of your tyrannical nonsense. The people demand a new leader, and without one I suspect we're all headed to voat.co\nI don't want reddit to continue like this\nEllen Pao is a threat to Reddit as a platform of free speech\nEllen pao is ruining reddit\n\nDo the right thing\nI hate this Asian monkey, cut her head off her shoulders! And I want my old good Reddit back.\nReddit will never function in its original intent with this person at the wheel.  \nHonestly, if you're going to piss off everyone you claim to be trying to help, you lose all credibility.\nI don't agree with the censorship decisions of Ellen K. Pao\nshes bad\nReddit is a place to be free. \nEllen Pao is ruining reddit, stop the cancer!\nTo see free speech as an obstacle for marginalized groups in the quest for acceptance speaks volumes of anyone who holds that opinion is truly the \"privileged\" one in the situation.\nFree speech\nreddit is of life.\nthe people have spoken - time for Pao to move on.  if she's as skillful as she claims to be that shouldn't be a problem.  oh and rehire Victoria.\nThe brilliance and freshness of Reddit's audience and user-generated content is being failed by stale features, lack of development, and poor decision-making.\nFreedom \nShe is ruining reddit\nI hate change\nI think Pao is a terrible CEO for a great website. \nPlease leave, cant stand seeing your face and you spoilt what was a perfect past time for me\nPao needs to go.  She's wrecking Reddit\nbring back the real Reddit\nI don't want Reddit to suck.\nBecause she doesn't know how to socialize with the community and the websites staff. The website was far better with the old CEO.\nShe's a criminal, and has to go.\nanti-fascist\nEllen is handling these situations so wrong and we should have a CEO who is able hold Reddit in its glory!\ncensorship sucks\nI'm opposed to restrictions on free speech on Reddit.\nporque quiero alv\nFiring of Victoria Taylor was disgraceful and unwarranted\nPao is some synonym for retarded that doesn't put special needs people down.\nshe's ruining life\nIt is unfair to censor the intenet\nfuck this birch.\nShe's a cunt\nI love reddit and she is completely out of tough with the site.\nFreedom of reddit should be allowed, this is about the users and the users have chosen, either a step down happens or reddit is done. \nI hate what she's done with the place\nThis madness needs to stop\nI'm not adversely affected by any of this because I don't particularly go to Reddit, but this person doesn't seem fit at all to be what she is.\nShe's horrible. \nBecause Reddit is a community that stays together.\nEllen Pao is killing reddit and everything that makes reddit so great \nElen Pao is ruining reddit!\nEllen Pao (aka Chairman Pao, after infamous Chinese dictator Mao Zedong), is a cunt who does not deserve being a main admin of reddit. I, as a moderator of /r/crappydesign deserve better mod transparency.\nDominic ballesteros\n150k isn't a small number. Hopefully the publicity from this petition gets something done. \nEllen Pao is a self centred, retarded and overall bad choice as an employee for any company, let alone a CEO position. Fuck her and her family. I hope she rolls over and dies tomorrow.\nReddit is supposed to be a site to share ideas, not selected and censored.\nI am against censorship\nI believe she is slowly destroying the website but more so the community \nEllen is ruining what used to be a nice company. \nfor positive change for the community\nThere wat reddit is run right now will take it down.\nChairman Pao is not just short-sighted and incompetent, she's incredibly shady and lecherous.\nCause teroras\nI'm a moderator and I want freedom of expression \nLong time user, would hate to see my favourite site ruined by bad business practice\nI'm a sheep\nShe needs to go\nEllen Pao is the epitome of everything that's wrong with the world today.\nDown with PAO\nAnyone that uses \"feminism\" as an excuse to forward their own agenda is a disgrace.\nA community based site should listen to those that populate it, not just the money that it could make. \n\nWhen you get rid of the people that make it awesome, you are telling your community to leave...is that what you really want?\ni do what i want 'Murica\nI dont want another hitler\nAuthoritarian style of leadership, disconnected from the userbase, firing key employees, is she intentionally trying to ruin reddit?\nI hate when people sue for Gender discrimination. I think she knows how to work the game legally and has very few morals. Someone like that should not be a CEO. If we could have CEOs doing good things like elon musk, then we would be in a better place as a race. This lady is a gold digger of business.\nfuck pao\nThat scoundrel wont censor us anymore!\nReddit has gone downhill, her comments of 'vocal minority' are wrong\nShe's just not doing it for the people, man.\nFuck her \nreddit used to be good before her.\nWant her to resign\nEllen Pao is ruining Reddit.  This is not what Aaron Swartz would have wanted for the community of Reddit.\nI hate Ellen Pao!\nreddit told me \nI love reddit and it hasn't been the same lately. I feel like it is going to go down at this pace because it's new policy and censorship is ruining it's original aim.\nI stand with Reddit\nI am unhappy with the conditions of recent firings\nBecause i love Reddit\nBecause we were once a hub of communication and activity, we would have differen discussions and talk about all kinds of things, yet we lost it all completely with ellen pao, we lose subs and important people for the sake of monetization and then we become no better then something like 9Gag, and then it just becomes a copy cat that gains no sort of money whatsoever. \nStop killing Reddit, step down with dignity \nHope Victoria get her job back\nI disagree with her take on Reddit. And she had the audacity of saying only the minority cares about what happened, and the majority of users,  that just read Reddit without posting, doesn't care about the events that occurred. She forgot that the \"minority\" that is fed up with her are the ones who make the content of Reddit for the said majority to read and access the website.\nG for Go AWAY.\nI like reddit and don't like the direction it is moving in. \nI want to see Reddit grow and rise as a community, and this is a step backwards.\nPeer pressure \nThe Reddit community is unstable and needs to be sorted out.\nI don't want Reddit destroyed\nellen pao cunt\nPao is a Cunt. \nI agree with the petition.\n200,000 signatures here we come! Let's find a chief executive officer who is in touch with their company!\nEllen K. Pao is not fit to be the CEO of reddit. why run a company you do not like? \nI disagree with the action Ellen has taken with the company and has ruined a very valuable Internet community.\nIt's a vote of no confidence. \nI believe reddit should be censorship-free \nReasons.\nMany people are employed by reddit, It'd be a terrible thing to see them lose their jobs over one person's arrogant idiocy.\nReddit should not be censored.\nfuck her\nWe wont  let kung pao destroy reddit.\nNot really a fan\nEllen pao needs to go\nShe took down r/fatpeoplehate\nEllen Pao is against freedom of speech, which is a core principle in reddit's existance.\nSJW's must be opposed\nWhy the hell not\nShe has ruined Reddit. \nI see the future and it ain't pretty.\nI liked Reddit before fatpeoplehate was banned and before Victoria was let go/fired. \nI dont like her\nidfwu\n I want to see reddit burn so they should get rid of someone who made them famous.\nI really don't give a shit about this shit.\nI used to love reddit, and wish it a better future.\nPao is running Reddit into the ground and I don't want to see it like this.\nshes has ruined reddit\neqweasd\nEllen Pao's complete lack of understanding regarding her company & userbase is resulting in the destruction of an otherwise great website.\nEllen's ideas really don't stroke with the spirit of the site and its communities.\nPao is going to run this company into the ground.\nReddit is an open place that Pao doesn't understand\nDestroying the free speech of the internet is the exact opposite concept of Reddit.\nEllen Pao has fucked up to bad to be forgiven and should get out.\nI'm signing because I remember when there was a time where I would actually ENJOY opening up my browser and seeing my homepage as reddit.\ni don't like women CEO\n/u/chooter\nThe free speach platform that reddit was is slowly getting destroyed by the censorship and banning of subreddits from mrs Pao.\nNumerous issues\nI want reddit to be back to normal\nBring fatpeoplehate back, shit was funny and truth\nAMERICA\nI'm here because censorship has taken over shit that people needs to be aware of. If you continue down this path, there will be a true shitstorm.\nReddit lost some of its best aspects under her jurisdiction.\nCensorship is never ok.\nNo matter what Ellen Pao has done (or not done) there is no way she can effectively leadi this company in the face of this sort of public backlash.  She needs to move on for the good of the company, no matter what has actually happened.  She obviously does not understand public relations at all.\nshe's not helpful to the Reddit community.\nI think that she is a problem?\nFrom what i ve read. You got butt hurt. Wanted to say you were right when you were wrong. Then. Got even more mad. Annnnd made it worse. Good job..... Bitch.(no harm intended)\nPlease go run some other business into the ground, thank you. :)\nSigned because I like reddit and Pao needs to go.\nEllen Pao is toxic for Reddit and needs to step down, she is in no way fit to lead this company, just look at her track record\nI'm signing because I don't want Reddit to dead.\nReddit has been a shit storm since Ellen pao has been in charge \nLove reddit, but dont like the route is taking\nBecause muh triguurr\nRemoving Victoria is the worst decision ever.\nget the fuck out\nVictoria's sudden dismissal and the general move of Reddit towards a run of the mill clickbait site. Thank you!\nVictoria is always in  my heart!\nEllen Pao and board is ruining reddit\nEllen Pao ain't no good.\nI feel recent changes in the management of reddit are not in line with my own use of the service.\nI stand for free speech and free expression. I don't agree with the censorship of controversial subs such as /r/fatpeoplehate while others pushing racism and bigotry continue. Either allow all expression or none. The decision to let go Victoria and the lack of engagement with the mods by the admin team is disturbing. This cannot be glossed over. The direction Reddit is taking since Ms Pao took over is not good for the company or the dedicated community that contribute, moderate and use reddit everyday. I've been a redditor for 5 years. \nEllen pao is a dillweed\nEnough is enough. Any responsible, sensible board would remove her and Alexis immediately, publicly and loudly.\nFuck pao\nShe is an evil person and is a disgrace to the human race.\nEllen K. Pao shares zero values that Reddit used to stand for.\nI don't agree with the blatant disregard for what the userbase and the moderators want and need in this site. \nEllen pao is comparable to Satan \nFuck Ellen Pao\nI like Reddit the way it is.\nEllen needs to go. Has ruined the Reddit community and has shown no intent to make Reddit any better.\nthe internet should be open!!\nShe's bad \nI do not think she is suited for this position\nReddit\nReddit and its direction now blows \nElen Pao is a cunt and looks like a transvestite alien.\nboooo ellen pao\nQuero que ela saia\nVIVA LA REVELUCÍON\nshe is changing the direction of reddit\nReddit needs a culture change. They have forgotten what the original goal of creating reddit as a platform was and what made it so great. If they continue on their current goal of simply making it as marketable as they can, it will be the end of the site. The first change to prevent this is to remove Ellen Pao as Interim CEO. \nShe doesn't understand how us reddit users fully. The whole point of reddit is that its a place where you can be your self and get your content and by banning people from being themselves and fixing things that dont need to be fixed is someone we dont need running reddit. \nella no es buena para reddit. :-(\nThis is bull.\nI think that Ellen does not have the right approach to running this company\nYou fucked up. Real bad. \nShe's terrible \nPuck Fao\nI love reddit\nStupidity must be punished.\nI want to\nEllen Pao is the internet equivalent to Adolf Hitler. Reddit will be so much better without her. \nI don't believe in CEOs who don't give a shit about it's loyal users. \nfuck pao\nfuck that ugly cunt. just use the severance from your golden parachute to get a dick sewn on so your face matches the rest of your body.\nReddit was a beautiful, interesting, and generally awesome place for people to share ideas, information, news, and communities. Since she's come into power, her decisions or pack there of, have caused a downfall in the good of Reddit.\nI dislike communist.\nShe is Godzilla, Reddit is Japan.\nI think Ellen is simply not cut out for the job. These last few months on Reddit have been the worst time in the sites history.\nshes ruininig my favorite website\nNo more Censorship! \nIt is evident that she is not doing a decent job, and is not open minded to constructive criticism.  She needs to step down.\nEllen Pao is a danger to the future of Reddit.\nFiring Victoria was the final straw. \nI don't like being censored.\nI am supporting this cause to make Pao steps down as the Reddit's CEO.\nFuck that bitch\nEllen Pao sucks\nCensorship is clubber productive to user submitted content\nShe must be removed.\nI think the censorship needs to stop and i dont want reddit ran into the ground.\nPao is dreadfully out of her depth and clearly doesn't understand how Reddit works. While she rightfully points out that millions of visitors don't care about the inner workings of Reddit, she overlooks the fact that it's not those viewers, but the vast majority of moderators and content creators who do care that make the site work for those millions of viewers.\nIm kinda chauvinistic\nI want reddit to survive and it looks like it won't with this women at the helm. \nI have not seen any proof lately that Reddit admins and the CEO are attempting to take the site in a direction that would enhance or benefit the community in any way.\nellen pao is destroying reddit\nReddit deserves employees who care about the users\nEllen Pao must go down\nI'm signing because I believe Pao's vision of reddit isn't inline with mine or the majority of reddit's users.\nFor the reddit\npao is destroying reddit. Sha has to go or I will find another online community. \nReddit is destroyed. \nEllen Pao has no talents other than knowing how to call a lawyer \nyou don't ban shit you don't like\nToo much drama with this one. \nEllen Pao is ruining reddit\nFuck Pao\nI have loved reddit for years and feel this shift is not in the websites best interest.\nShe needs to go. \nCensorship\nPao is going to turn reddit into digg 2.0\nShe is everything this website against. She is taking our right of freedom of speech away from the community whose foundation was on being able to have a free mind and free ability to speak and view what every their freakish minds wanted to. when I join this website about 3 years ago I joined because I had the ability to roam around what really is around me whether be hatred, gruesome, or just dogs and cats and that's what it's really about.\nChange needs to come to Reddit! Chairman Pao is killing everything it stands for. Viva liberty! Viva Victoria! Viva Reddit!!!\nJ.Weinhardt\nBeen a redditor since HS, can't leave it to die..\nEllen Pao is ruining reddit\nBring Victoria back.\nshe needs to go\nshe needs to go. she's ruined reddit\nShe is mis-focused\nUnjustified Dismissal and lack of consumer based feedback reform \nEllen K. Pao is ruining reddit\nI'm signing because random strangers on the internet told me to. Also, yeah, this power-hungry feminist needs to leave Reddit if she's so frightened by free speech.\nReally prefer Reddit the way it used to be - weird, exiting, vibrant and random. \nFuck Pao\nShe sucks\nEllen Pao's policies have ruined a beautiful collective environment for people.\nReddit used to be about freedom of speech. Its very structure imbued democracy into its veins and led its users to believe they were relevant; that their up and downvotes actually meant something. Ellen Pao evidently doesn't share this view. \n\nYou cannot make colossal changes like those which have afflicted Reddit recently without at least consulting the userbase. Reddit, particularly its moderators, have been brilliant at this in the past. What seems to have taken hold is a new regime where one person in particular, as we have been led to believe, seems to think herself and her opinion more relevant than anyone else's. This must stop if Reddit is to survive. \nReddit deserves better\nBecause I'm tired of hearing about it\nReddit is going to shit \nEllen Pao is bad for reddit Inc and the international brand would be better served by an individual that understands how the community works. \nFuck pao \nI agree with the sentiment of this petition \nCirclejerk\nshes killing reddit\nKeep Reddit a platform for free and uncensored information. \nNot the right CEO for Reddit.\nFuck Ellen Pao\nPao is just another psychotic feminist who sues their way to the top. While using SJW's to censor our free speech online. \nShe's a horrible CEO. \nI'm not a give fab of censorship and random upheaval of an entertaining site. \nI'm signing because I use reddit a lot\nI used to love reddit and I don't like Ellen Pao as CEO.\nYea\nShe's ruining reddit\nI think Ellen pao should resign.\nShe looks like an evil piece of corporate scum.\nPao is becoming a dictator and power hungry.  It baffles me that after all the time it has been online, that she thinks she can change the very foundation on what Reddit was built on! \nShe needs to go, now.\nReddit deserves better\nEllen Pao's a fucking cum swallowing filthy cunt whore. \nnot only is the company twisted and corrupted but the whole thing about transparency has been depleted.. we need to get our internet back\nI'm worried about the direction on the site. Unpublished or unclear rules being enforced selectively and secretly are no way to inspire confidence to content providing users. \nPao doesn't understand reddit or it's user base, in fact it doesn't seem like anyone at reddit does anymore.\nI want reddit to get better, not worse.\nThe changes that have taken place under Ellen Pao have already curbed my usage of Reddit.\nI'm signing because I do not want this site to go into the trash. Bring it back to normal.\nShe is fattening up Reddit to sell it off, which in turn will provide it with a slow demise like Digg\nReddit's quality has gone down in many ways since she became CEO. While changes are natural and aren't always smooth int he beginning, after whats happened, I believe she has been put in charge of reddit to monetize the site, against its original intent. This is wrong.\nEllen K. Pao is not the CEO Reddit deserves. The people are speaking, she needs to step down. \nShe is denying freedom.\nSomeone has to.\nEllen Pao is a person who does not understand the business she is managing. She does not deserve to be CEO of a company that she is driving into the ground.\nSince her arrival, some of the last bastions of internet free speech have been shut down for censorship's sake.\nI believe this website deserves someone in charge who actually cares about the people who both maintain and visit it. \nI'd rather not see reddit get run into the ground, thanks.\nPro has destroyed reddit!\nI don't wish bad managment would effect the site I have grown to love/hate so much :)\nFUCK CHAIRMAN PAO! \nI feel she has not performed her duties as CEO as described.\nEllen Pao is dishonest!\nEllen Pao is destroying Reddit.

Shadiness. Rights.\nShe's ruining Reddit.\nThe recent events have showcased that Ellen Pao is not a suitable leader for reddit as a community.\nRemove pao as ceo of reddit \nShe a how\nCirclejerk\nShe blows\nPao has been failing as both a leader to a community as well as a CEO to a company's shareholders. Her policies have damaged the reddit experience as well as its integrity as a site that could otherwise be monetized responsibly. \nI want reddit to be the best place for everyone to be online.\nI want to poke Pao's elitist eyeballs out with a dull Dixon Ticonderoga #2 pencil. \nThe lack of censorship is why i come here. \nI think by her actions, Ellen Pao is not a people orianted leader...  Not good when you consider she is in a job were she sould be...\nshe's a cunt\nShe just needs to go, guys...\nI want to see a new hope in reddit. Darth Pao's authority must be relinquished.\nReddit hasn't been the same since the age of Pao started.\nI want a ppublic statement to the community itself not through some other form of medi\nI'd like Ellen Pao to step down.\nBecause Ellen Pao is the worst.\nI am dissapointed in the direction that Reddit has gone since Ellen Pao has been in control. \n\nI am also really dissapointed that she has not stepped up to the plate and reached out to the Reddit community, since it is clear that we are extremely upset.\nFuck ellen pao\nEllen has gone mad with power and does not understand the Internet! \nI have been a member of Reddit for 5 years, and I believe it is a place where free speech and opinion should be upheld. \nWhy does she hate freedom?\nFuck her in the bum\ni want my fatpeoplehate back\nim tired of shit happening on reddit becuase of her, i didnt care about fat people hate going down and i didnt care about the admin workings behind the scenes i just want the fucking site to work and i want to go on ask reddit without problems\nI wan't our Reddit to LIVE ON! \nshe sucks\nHail Chairman Pao!\nreddit needs to be run by someone who knows the community they are representing.\nPao acted wrong and should take the wrongs\nAs a hardcore Redditor for 4 years now, I want nothing but good things for the site. \nEllen Pao is a piece of shit cunt who is running Reddit into the ground.\nI believe in reddits freedom!\nswag\n10\nI have been a redditor for 8 years and do not like the direction she is leading the organization/community.\nPao right in the kisser\nshe needs to GTFO\nSomething needs to be done about this clownfiesta.\ni want reddit to remain a good website\npao's a cunt fuck reddit and fuck all the weeaboos\nI want her to resign\nshe's going against what reddit stands for\nshe's hitler\nPao needs to resign she is asking reddit a miserable place to visit\nshe is out of her element \nEllen Pao is a opportunist and a disaster as CEO. Get her out.\nSo far Ellen K. Pao has shown no real knowledge of Reddit's values and function and I feel she will destroy the site and community.\nI am a redditor\nellen pao needs to step down \nshe has no idea what she is doing\nI have used reddit for 2 nearly 3 years now and I loved it because it was a free and open place for people to be themselves be it that they are racist bigots or just complete assholes or creepy gore photos. Everyone had their likes and dislikes and everyone had their place to hangout and speak with like minded people for entertainment! But pao has fucked this and we need to fuck her off now.\nEllen Pao is ruining reddit\nShe made Kleiner Perkins the good guy. \nUnqualified and hateful\nUnqualified and hateful\nShe is unfit for her position \nim against pao as the current CEO of reddit\nShe's needs gone now! \nI honestly don't want reddit going in its current direction\nI don't like the path reddit is taking under her direction.\nEllen pao is not very liked \nI'm signing because Ellen Pao does not make the best decisions for the longevity, strength and viability of Reddit.\nEllen Pao is a commie filth\nShe is ruining reddit\nshe is not fit for the job\nbecause fuk u nazi \nPuck Fao\nShe's a dumbfuck \nReddit need to be a place of free speech,\nShe is toxic to the community and company\nVery disappointed in how the Victoria firing was handled, but more so by the firm's poor treatment of their unpaid moderators.\nReddit told me to\nThe slow death of a great place\nbecause fuck pao! That's why\nI dislike my favourite site being royally fucked over.\nVictoria\nellen pao is useless\nEllen pao got zero swag units\npeer pressure\nEven stupid people need their right to say what the want.\nI am signing because I believe that abhorrent dictators like Ellen K. Pao should not be leading a website like Reddit that prides itself in preserving  freedom of speech and the freedom of the Internet. Ellen K. Pao, you are a loathsome human being. Make life easy for us all and please resign. \nI love this site and hate seeing it mismanaged. Change needs to happen before things are no longer salvageable.\nfuck the pao-lice\nEllen Pao is ruining the biggest website for free speech.\nI loved reddit... before Paocalypse\npeice of shit\nAt this point anything is better than what we have right now...\nOf the blatant and overzealous misuse of power by the reddit CEO as well as responding with a TIME article\nPao has done much damage to what was once a bastion of free speech online, and as someone who loved Reddit, it is shameful seeing to see the path Pao is taking it down.\nHorrible CEO and reddit hater must resign.\nPao has ruined the community of reddit as CEO and will continue to run it down with her inability to run a successful community. \nCencorship has no place in America\nProper leadership defines a company, especially one that relies solely on the support of its members and moderators for so much of its success. Reddit has not been moving in the proper direction and requires a change in leadership to correct itself. \nI am feed up with the unfair treatment of the user base of reddit. \nNao 2 Pao\nmurica\nReddit hq needs a serious cultural shift if it is to reconnect with its user base and retain the loyalty that made it successful so far.\nshes a huge cunt?\nEllen Pao has successfully turned reddit from a beloved free-speech community to a shit storm of censorship. No progress can be made while she is still part of Reddit.\nMs. Pao represents a breed of business person that seeks to only improve the self and not the company.\nPao simply doesn't care about the community. \nPao has no chill\nfreedom of speech is important to me.\nFuck Ellen Pao\nClearly the site has been run into the ground and the community isn't being respected.\nShes a bitch\nI believe in freedom of speech. \nA CEO who does not understand how their company's business works and alienates the community, is not worth it.\nyolo\nI've been a member of reddit for the last 5 years and I've never seen the quality of submissions as low as they are now. Subreddits that I frequently visit have gone private and the subreddits I appreciated the most are absolutely terrible. Pao's censoring of subreddits and the mass removal of moderators and administration is absolutely insane. Her practices are morally corrupt as a person and business leader. \nFreedom of speech\nfür ein freies reddit.\nEllen Pao is the wrong choice for CEO of a company/site which is a kernel of light and information in the online community.\n'Its just a vocal minority'. No Ellen, I would never normally sign a petition, because I am part of a silent majority of people who don't normally care enough. But now I cre enough about you.\nEllen Pao is a terrible person and shouldn't have control of a pet rock, let alone something as grand as reddit.\nI remember digg.\nEllen Pao is breaking the community.\nEllen is NOT the right person for the job, and she never deserved it to begin with.\nElen Poe should not be the CEO\nEllen Pao is destroying the bedrock of reddit\nI have not read a thing about Ellen Pao over the last 6 years that would give me confidence in her abilities to run a corporation. Too much evidence that she is not an upstanding character person. That STILL counts!\nEllen Pao needs to be stopped at any and all cost. The current reddit administration is an abomination.\nI believe Reddit should be open sourced and operated by its community and not by a single vision (Pao).\nEllen Pao is killing reddit.\nOP told me to\nasian cunt\nwe need a ceo who cares about the community \nYou should step aside for a new CEO who actually is a member of the community.\nI don't want to see a site that I've enjoyed for two years run into the ground and turn into Buzzfeed. \nPosition has become laughable, needs moving on as she has no idea what reddit is all about\nCircle jerk\nVictoria ;-;\nI orginally wasn't planning on signing but after her comment calling the protesting group a MINORITY it became obvious how much she refuses to see how truly ignorant her actions have been.  It's like she is just trying to sweep this under the rug with out acknowledging that the users don't really want her her anymore \nI don't like Ellen\nI love my reddit community and it want it to continue to thrive freely.\nLiterally hitler\nReddit needs a great line of communcation between the mods and admins and if she is running an untight ship for the admins this communication just cannot exist!!\nellen PAO is ruining the things that make reddit good. \nEllen pao needs to go.\nFUCK THIS BITCH\nI'm sick of seeing subreddits being destroyed.  Even if I don't visit them, this is the Internet and they all have their place regardless of how I feel about them.\nFDB\nEllen Pao is undeserving to be at the helm of reddit\nIm signing because hive mind mentality. \nDegrading reddit daily.\nShe is not properly running reddit in the way reddit is supposed to be run other than pure monetary motivation\nOf all the recent censorship that has been happening.\nEllen pao sucks\nFuck Ellen \nShe is ruining reddit\nEllen Pao is an awful human being and, more importantly, an awful CEO.\nfuck Ellen Pao\nI hate what reddit has become since this person became ceo\nEllen Pao is a terrible ceo\nI saw an interview of her and I strongly believe people like her are what is wrong with the world\nI am bad person\nBecause fuck her, Need a new CEO\nchange is needed yo\nfuck ellen pao, i want reddit back to its regular shit fest circle jerk state\nThis woman is a liar and a cheat\nShe is quite possibly one of the worst CEOs of a company within the decade.\nELLEN K PAO NEEDS TO STEP DOWN FROM REDDIT.\nI want to fight back. \ni want change\nShe's awful and is killing everything that is great about Reddit. Also I heard she is a witch who eats babies. \nI have concerns that the current course Reddit is taking under Pao's leadership will ultimately cause much of the userbase to leave for another site.\n\nIn my mind the only way to prevent that and regain the community's trust is to find new leadership.\nPao isnt a good CEO \nShe is toxic and needs to go.  She does not understand the company and her role.\nI believe in a free speech platform and Ellon Pao stands against that completely.\nI'm signing this because Pao's dimples are slightly distracting from my hatred.\nI think failure should be punished if success is to be rewarded. \nEllen sucks\nEllen Pao is Hitler reincarnated.\nReddit has been moving from a free discussion forum to a click bait site that only allows speech it agrees with\nShe is not a good fit for the reddit culture. \nMURICA\nMiss Pao has created unwarranted polarity among us without interjection to dissuade technical issues.\nShe has shown an egregiouslack of leadership  and/or basic principles of what the site is and how people connect utilizing iy.\nFuck you, Pao. You aren't a redditor, just a profit whore.\nshe obviously doesnt know what shes doing. \nfuck ellen pao\nPao is ruining reddit.\nYou can not run a content aggregating site that is user rated and promoted AND THEN censor it.  You're stopping the conversation and molding it to be based on your self interests. \nshe is driving Reddit into the ground. \nKeep your hands off of language. Let it evolve. strong enough to use it do so. \nFuck Pao\nShe doesn't value the spirit of Reddit and is turning it into something it's not.\nI enjoy Redfin and do not want to see it to continue to head in a poor direction.\nI love reddit, but not Ellen Pao\nToxic CEO hated by majority of the people that use the website. How can you make money when most of the user base hate you? \nEllen K. Pao is a manipulative individual who should not be able to represent reddit as CEO\nShe's not doing a very good job as a CEO. As a frequent \"customer\" to the website, I find her performance to be very lack luster and overall killing the Reddit experience.\nPao Zedong is literally hitler. \nThis company is mismanaged.\nDon't stay where you are not wanted\nI have great respect for the moderators of Reddit and the work they do, and support their dismay at recent events.\nReddit should be open and free of censorship \n\nShe is ruining REDDIT.\nEllen Pao is a disgrace to the reddit community. She must go.\nPao is cancer to a wonderful community\nI am deeply disappointed in Pao's performance as a CEO of reddit.\nShe needs to go, or we will.\nI believe that reddit could use new leadership.\nI agree with the sentiment of the petition and the statements held by its author\nStop screwing up reddit\nEllen pao is worse than Hitler \nCensorship of any kind is unacceptable, especially in a place that places votes on what should and should not be seen.\nAbsolutely the wrong leader of a forum I've ever witnessed. Clearly disconnected and leader less the forum \"reddit\" is on its way down without a quality leader.\nReddit must be free\nPao, right in the kisser.\nPao is of poor moral character\nShe's the worst \nReddit is a great website and Pao is really turning it into a craphole. I love my online community, stop trying to censor it! Also stop removing some of the best parts like Victoria!\nthis shits broken and pao has done nothing but be against her community since the community \nPao is a failure as reddit's CEO\nClearly there has been some philosophical changes at corporate. I vehemently disagree with the state of reddit and would like to see a new management operate reddit. Ellen Pao ought to step down as CEO of Reddit.\nEllen is not fit for the position of CEO or Reddit. \nVictoria YES! Ellen Pao NO!\nI don't like censorship, and believe everyone has a right to be heard what they believe weather or not the rest of the world likes it. \nshe is incompetent\nI don't want reddit to be driven further unto the ground.\nfuck pao in her little butt\nfuck Ellen Pao \nI'm signing because someone who is both bold enough to say she is improving the community, while she is actually actively destroying it, and tactless enough to say that the community is oblivious to what is going on is never going to be able to effectively run a community centered organization like reddit.  \nI'm signing because Reddit is part of my daily life, as much as I hate to admit it. I love the internet. Reddit is a community we can all vouch for, and I only want what is best for it.\nI'm signing because Pao should not stand in the forefront of a community she does not comprehend.\nShe obviously doesn't care about her user's \nDown with Pao.\nI want to see Reddit stay around for a long, long time and we need someone who actually cares about the user base to lead it.\nshes ruining reddit\nFuck ellan pao\nReddit\nI'm signing because Ellen and her husband are horrible people.\nI liked reddit for the freedom it offered. Pao has turned it into an SJW censorship machine.\nSince Pao has taken the reins as CEO, her policies have caused increasingly negative effects that will eventually destroy the Reddit community and leave it a husk like Digg.\nI dislike the way shes hanging the company of reddit. \nBecause reddit belongs to the people of the internet ,and it is a way to connect with like minded people\nI dont believe Ellen Pao is the right CEO for Reddit and doesn't understand enough about it to run it \nDown with pao\nI want Reddit to keep its free speech spirit and I don't support the way Miss Pao handles the company..\nI'm signing because I don't want the site to continue to suffer. \nPao is toxic to our community and needs to be removed.\nFuck pao\nI'm here with the torches and pitchforks.\nBitch needs to be stopped before reddit loses its fanbase.\nEllen Pao is an awful person who is ruining her company by not communicating properly or adhering to the demands of the community and the moderators. \nEllen Pao is running Reddit into the ground. She needs to go. Fuck her.\nI'm signing because reddit used to be consistently enjoyable and free of egg shells that need to be walked on lightly.  SHE IS GOING TO RUIN THIS WEBSITE. Please put someone in charge who understands reddit's ideals of free speech\nRabble rabble rabble!!!\nI'm signing because Ellen Pao is seeing you next tuesday\nShe shouldn't be making decisions affecting Reddit when she doesn't understand Reddit. Simple. \nReddit has become shit \nYour gender is not a tool with which to advance your career by filing false claims.\nShe does not understand Reddit, and she is a terrible person to boot. Down with this sort of thing.\nPao is a bitch\nI'm an employeed, self sufficient adult and I think Ellen K. Pao is a terrible person. \nIt's time. Go away now.\nBiased Pao\nIf someone is going to run something, they should care about it.\nEllen Pao I will sucker punch you ! \nim against censorship. I want Reddit to be an open forum for discussion and learning. Ellen is ruining Reddit. \nShe is destabilizing a community that users are very proud of. Go away now, please. \nBringing down fatpeoplehate? Under the guise of a \"family friendly\" reddit? And yet leaving a dozen other VERY uncomfortable sub-reddits. You can't just pick and choose what is acceptable and what isn't Pao. Either all of it is, or none of it. Drop the fucking censorship brush and grow a spine.\nEllen Pao is a cunt\nShe's clearly out of touch. Reddit will be the next Digg if she doesn't step down.\nNot likeable \nIt seems obvious to me that Ms. Pao wants to add a corporate touch to the Reddit community. I work for a large corporation and if I wanted my media to be touched by a huge corporation I would join yammer. \nReddit is losing the community-run ethic that appeals to me and many other users, and makes reddit unique among other content-aggregating sites.\nFuck Censorship.\nI don't  support censorship.\nI want her out. Now. \nEllen is not good for Reddit.\nbecause the Internet \nF*** censorship\nI support a free speech forum over current censorship policies.\nShe horrible and a censoring fatkin\nDisingenuous lady\nPao is out of touch with the community that make Reddit possible and has lost the plot. In many eyes she was a wrong appointment from the beginning and the gender discrimination case is just a great example what kind of person she is\nFuck ellen\nEllen Pao is a joke that needs to go.\nEllen Pao has ruined what used to be my favorite site, now it just feels cheap and boring, much like Ellen Pao\nI believe that Ellen Pao does not have the best intentions of the userbase to be in charge. \nMiss the old Reddit, don't approve of censorship \nI disagree with many of the recent changes that have being going on at Reddit and Reddit Inc. How much is the fault of Ellin Pao I cannot say however change needs to be made.\nCensorship and corporatization has to stop. \nShe has changed reddit for profit motives instead of making it a good site that also makes profit. Ruining the community and being a bad communicator should result in termination. This position require much more experience and thoughtfulness. \nChairman Pao is killing reddit. plz remove\nI don't like what's happening to reddit, and I despise Pao for her false gender discrimination case. \nThere seems to be an extreme lack of respect for the communities of reddit and she seems out of touch with her own brand.\nwhy not?\nellen Pao is a shite eco of reddit and is ruining something i used to enjoy thoroughly. \nEllen Pao is doing massive damage to Reddit\nShe needs to be removed from REDDIT.\nI'm signing because I hate people who censor free speech.\nShe has proven that we're not worth her time.\nshe sucks ass\n\nfor freedom\nI just want my peaceful community back. \nShe's a bitch\nShe's a horrible person, and I love reddit. \nI feel she is destroying what reddit was supposed to be about in the first place by heavily censoring the website. Reddit was a platform intended for free speech and discussion. \nUnnecessary Cenorship and poor management.\nPao clearly doesn't understand the userbase of reddit or how it functions. By removing Victoria, a valuable liaison and necessary admin on reddit, and not taking the necessary steps to provide a replacement to ensure the IAMA process still works, she demonstrates a clear lack of understanding and disconnect between her and her company's product.\nShe in no way represents the freedom that Reddit stands for. On the contrary, she personally opposes the beliefs.\nPao needs to stop \nI want Reddit to be uncensored and community based\nscrew Ellen Pao. \nSHAME\nEllen Pao is a bad CEO who doesn't care about her userbase.\nI'm tired of people pulling lawsuits to get to the top\nHaving little faith that Ms. Pao is acting honorably in this matter, given her history, I am willing to give Victoria the benefit of the doubt and endorse this and assume some fowl play.\nshe is not good for reddit or anything internet related \nI believe in free speech\nApoyo a la comunidad de reddit\nI understand why Ms. Pao has made changes to Reddit, but her execution of changes and mismanagement of the aftermath shows that she is not fit to be CEO of a website she does not understand.\nI'm a feminist and I strongly believe that  Ellen Pao is bad for women, equality, and social progress.\n\nDoesn't have any interest in the well being of reddit.com \nEllen Pao has to go\nall the cool kids are doing it\nCompanies should care about their customers\nIt's time.\nTime to say goodbye pao\npao is a terrible CEO\nThis bitch gots a head shaped like a shovel.\nSJWs are like a form of virtual cancer lol\nFuck pao\nas a member of the reddit community, i feel the removal of Virgina will be detrimental to reddit and its users\nI used to enjoy reddit. Since Pao took over reddit, the changes she has made has changed the site for the worse in every step. If she steps down and reddit reverses its stance on the policies she has had changed under her watch, I might stay on reddit. Until then, I'll be else where on the internet.\nShe needs to leave\nI'm the mod of 3 subreddits. She has lost our trust and any reasonable leadership. \nEllen, I don't like how you're running reddit. Until you step down, I'll be using other websites. Yeah, like voat.\nShe's a bitch\nI want reddit to survive\nFuck you Ellen Pao. Fuck you.\nShe is a terrible CEO and the world would be a better place without people like her.\nI don't support the 3rd Reich\nBecause that bitch, hope she gets put 6ft under\ni don't like her recent choices\nI'm signing because I do not believe that Ellen Pao will take reddit in the direction that I want to see it go as a long time user.\nReddit should be a 100% free speech platform. Check out /r/undelete for evidence of censorship, and check out Pao's NPR interview in which she says she intends to censor reddit.\nbitch\nOther than she is a terrible person?\nThe original personnel actions that precipitated the problems were very, very poorly handled, and handling of subsequent damage control has been executed even more poorly.  I'd like to see reddit continue as an important part of the online experience, and do not see how this is possible without significant and decisive change of management.\nChairman Pao must go. \nReddit has gotten much worse since she took over. I would have bought gold (given funds) before, but not now.\nI believe Ellen Pao should step down as CEO of Reddit.\nI don't want to move to chan's. I simply don't want to see reddit dies.\nShe is a money hungry fraud and needs to go!!\nPao is destroying what Reddit was meant to be.\nBecause fuck the system\nI'm signing because reddit has turned to shit as of late, and I'd like to see some new blood come in and right the ship. \nNo offense but she just doesn't understand Reddit.  She has to go\nI'm 5 years in, and only in the past 3 months have I ever thought to look for an alternative. \nI really like Reddit as it was\nI want her out\nReddit has gone to shit while she has been at the helm\nI believe that Ellen is highly detrimental to Reddit's success.\nIf I had the chance to stop Hitler I would, now ask yourself the same question?\nShe is unqualified for the position and a con artist.\nReddit sucks\nBecause she is doing a piss poor job.\nFirst Amendment \ni want reddit back to how it was \nsadasd\nHey hey ho ho Pao gots to go\nPlease do not become another Digg.\nellen pao sucks\nShes a cunt\nEllen clearly is out of touch and ineffective at leading.\nAs interim she's making a lot of damage tot he community with the decitions.\nReddit has gone downhill fast since she arrived.\nI'm signing because, not that this is about Victoria, but if Ellen thinks removing someone like Victoria (let alone how it was done) is something that can just be done without expecting any kind of feed back from the community, she clearly doesn't understand the culture of the website she is CEO of. And that is not something I would expect stockholders would want. Ideally if you are trying to monetize the website, it helps if you can explain what is is all about to potential advertisers. \nEllen Pao is out of touch with the community and has the computer literacy of a 5 year old. \nThe debacle on Reddit was unacceptable. Period.\ni have autism\nellen pao is a bad person\nShe has no business here. She gives women in tech and business a bad name.\nPao is not qualified to run reddit.\nShe needs to resign now\nI'm signing because no one has the right to control the thoughts and ideas of others. Free speech is a basic human right. Chairman Pao can go live in North Korea with likeminded people.\nShe has handled reddit the worst way possible and comes off at somebody who does not care about the user but rather the money from the website.\nReddit needs someone better\nReddit has gone down hill\nFrom everything I've read and my 3 years on Reddit, this woman has somehow fucked everything I love about this place up. I don't know how she hasn't already been thrown out by some kind of internal vote. How can the company not see how unhappy and outraged the community at large is?\nI believe in an uncensored reddit. \nEmperor Pao is out of touch with her own company and is not fit to lead it.\nI want her off of reddit. clear and simple.\nDue to management's poor handing of multiple events over the last year (and their general failure in adequately communicating intentions and/or reasoning to the Reddit community) I believe that the company, under the direction of Ellen Pao, is moving in a direction that is at odds with the ideas, values, and spirit inherent to Reddit.  I stand behind this petition and ask that Pao step down as CEO.\nShe has taken our first ammendment and thrown it right out the window because she doesn't want to hurt people's feelings. Also she is letting workers go for idiotic reasons and does nothing to support the Reddit community.\nellens a fraud\nI'm signing because I don't believe Ellen Pao has Reddit's best interests at heart.  \nShe is a terrible CEO. She should not be in charge of any major decisions at any company. Ever.\nPao make my body skin do hand stands forever and ever\ndon't like her policies. \nEllen Pao does not know how to run this website. She's out of touch with the user base and cannot understand what it requires.\nPao needs to step down because she is an unfit leader whom does not know how Reddit works. \nShe is going to be the destruction of reddit\nThe communication between the Reddit administration team to its subreddit moderators is very lacking and rather unsettling after years of empty promises to the moderators to improve and provide tools to help run subreddits, and ultimately Reddit as a whole, smoothly.\nShe's not very reddit. \nI'm for total freedom of speech\nIt is very clear she has issues, and it is very clear that Reddit has issues. Years of being a thriving community, now looking like it will soon close its doors. I feel Ellen though not solely responsible is not what Reddit needs. She is Vile.\nShe sucks\nFuck Ellen Pao\nI believe in free speech even if it means there can't be safe spaces\nFuck pao\nI don't want this terrible human being in charge of reddit\nShe needs relieve her position for someone with better judgement and understanding to fill her role. I do not believe she can change her ways \nPao's actions during this recent event have spoken enough about the quality of her leadership.\nI believe Ellen Pao to be unfit for the position of CEO of Reddit, Inc. based on empirical evidence including but not limited to blatant disregard for the users and contributors of reddit.com\nEllen's leadership has hurt the greater community.\nFuck dat bish\nDude, 150K people want you gone. Who are you fooling at this point?\nI agree that Ellen Pao has proven undeserving of the power granted to her.\nPao must resign, enough is enough. \nShe's nothing but trouble! \ni use reddit, this is stupid\nShe's inept\nVote of no confidence. Put Alexis in charge.\nI hate ellen\nEllen Pao is a manipulative bitch.\nI am tired of Ellen Pao's bad attitude.\nthis one's for /u/chooter\nPao must step down\nShe is a tyrant who needs to go\nellen pao is bad for reddit. she is running changes that affect reddit, and in no way can change reddit for good, only bad\nShe is failing reddit.com\nIt's Reddit; not North Korea. \nI love reddit and she does not\nI don't have anything against Ms. Pao, as some of the people seem to, but it seems abundantly clear at this point that she is underqualified and not equipped to be the CEO of a company such as Reddit, and she needs to step down to some other position better suited for her capabilities.\nIts time to get rid of the cancer killing reddit.\nI am against censorship! Especially where the internet is concerned. The internet must be kept a free place, and Ellen Pao is working against its freedom. She must not be allowed to destroy the front page of reddit.\npao fires good people based on bullshit excuses, she is a peerfect example of hitler in the new age.\nEllen Pao is destroying a website that millions use because she's getting butthurt.\nI love reddit for what it was, commercial site filled with retards like me. \ncunt\nEllen Pao and her minion admins are running the site into the ground.\nLack of transparency\nFuck Ellen Pao\nPao has failed to engage with the community in a constructive way after it was made clear that removing Victoria caused problems.\nShe is destroying the community we love. Fuck Al Sharpton. Don't do an ask me anything if there will be blowback for asking anything\nI liked reddit before this fascist \nPao must go. \nPao is a lair!\nReddit is being destroyed, individual's abilities to speak freely is being eroded by Ellen Pao and her team of moderators that rely upon their personal ideological slant to deform and judge over with impunity. The censorship has gotta out of control entirely and is entirely unacceptable.\nEllen Pao is a cunt\nI believe Ellen Pao does not have the best intentions for Reddit users in mind, her actions thus far in her career have been unprofessional and swinging towards a personal bias against certain points of view or freedom of speech.\n\nReddit is about giving a space for everyone to promote their ideas, as long as those ideas are within the boundaries of the law.\n\nCurrently under Ellen Pao reddit has gone out of it's way to silence some opinions for being too harsh while ignoring others that are just as abrasive.\n\nThere is an obvious agenda and bias in action.\n\nReddit should not play sides, it should only make sure that no illegal activities are going on, beyond that there should be no effort to silence certain opinions.\nEllen pao is not suitable as CEO for reddit\nWe dont need 2nd hitler in our world\nignoring your customers and your market is a fatal error for a CEO.\nWhy not, the rest of the place is going to eventually. \nEllen Pao has single handedly ruined the front page of the internet. \nHow can you run reddit if you're not a redditor?\nthis is a site I use a lot and love to read. The community is great but everything censored is a NO in my book and would hate to see this site go down\nI'm signing because i believe Ellen Pao  is unfit to run Reddit Inc.  I have noticed the website suffering within the past few months and I believe Ellen Pao is largly responsible.\nShe sucks.\nThis is ridiculous!  \ni feel that her actions are counter productive to what Reddit really is. Also these actions are leading the site down a road that will hinder its ability to make revenue gains. Gold has fallen and more and more advertisers are refraining from it. There are ways to monetize the site but her actions are sending it to the way of digg. \nFuckpao\nReddit is starting to suck\nBring back Victoria!\nI'm signing because fuck Ellen Pao\nfook u ellen p you suck smegma encrusted dick\nEllen Pao is trying to monetize reddit by censoring its users to make it more PR friendly. In it beginning it was a company that prided itself on free speech and now she is trying to hinder that American dream \nMaking a website exactly what its users don't want it to be\nThe Pao experiment has failed, let move on with a real CEO who will properly run the site and get things back the way they should be.\nswag\nShe's so arrogant and truly manipulative and malicious!\nHer glasses piss me off and how she's treated the wonderful mods of subs who don't receive a dime! While shitty glasses gets stupid rich. \nI support this petition's message.\nThis woman is ruining everything I love about Reddit.\nI'm signing because I think Ellen Pao should resign. \njust do it\nI fear for the death of one of my favorite websites\nReddit needs to communicate information in a better way to its community. I believe Ellen Pao has made some poor choices and disrespected the community that makes Reddit what it is. I fear Reddit will be destroyed.\nFuck Ellen Pao.\nEllen Pao is ruining Reddit. It isn't a company with her to monetize and make her own, it's a social network with all content created by the users and voted on by the users. Please make her step down before things get worse within the Reddit community.\nLeave it alone, reinstate Victoria. Why would you want to mess with the workings of the best site on the net?\nI care about Reddit.\ni, signing this because reddit has become something it never should have been. It has become a place where even the most ludicrous ideas are not welcomed. Reddit is for the sharing of ideas, jokes, and high\n\nly insensitive material. Free speech cannot be picked and chosen. This is the internet, let us troll, demean and do what we must to each other freely. \nEveryone else is\nReddit is a business we all understand this. But firing your truly one like employee doeskin help your business. Your PR with your customers will soon catch up to Reddit Inc.. With another large slip up such as this one there will be a mass exodus and you will never be considered to be a corporate executive again.\nEllen Pao is an alien, look at her creepy face. E.P. phone home!\nThis beautiful site it being ruined and this is the only way to remedy that\nI miss the old reddit. \nSHE IS CANCER\nWhat she is doing is wrong and people need to know the truth. Reddit doesnt deserve people like her. she is evil!!\nshe sucks mad weiners\nEllen Pao is not the right person to take the right path to reddit.\nEllen is a funny looking, scorned woman that's cheating her way to the American Dream by manipulating the court system with this gender BS! Instead of working hard and earning it, she goes rogue..not the American way at all; what do you think would happen in her country (wherever that is in Asia) if she tried this gender cheating crap? What incompetent individual allowed this? \nI am signing because I believe Ellen Pao is immoral and is using Reddit's platform to suit her agenda, she doesn't seem interested in the people that make the site work.\nSome people believe that absolute power corrupts absolutely.\n\nI've never been one to share that sentiment before. Instead, I've always believed that the ones that can truly be corrupted by absolute power are the ones who held corruption from the beginning.\n\nWith Ellen Pao, I can actively believe both at the same time.\n\nReddit is a site specifically designed to help people speak to those that align with their interests. There are subreddits for virtually every topic, even ones unsavory to the public. It's a fair system that has been in practice for some time.\n\nThe idea that someone could be against that sentiment while being the CEO of it is unsettling. It's even worse when she's controlling her image through deleting posts that criticize her or discounting the users of her site to the media. It's dishonest, to say the least. At best, it's just a step below dictatorship. Now, I won't make any North Korea comparisons, but it's a very real problem for a site that lives up to the ideals of freedom of speech.\nBecause she is ruining something I love\nEllen is restricting free speech. That's what Reddit is about.\nI quote below CaptainObviousMC. He(or she) gives a good overview why I'm signing, and why you, the owners and decision makers at Advance Publications should care about what is happening with Reddit:\n\n\"The thing is... She's absolutely right, I 100% don't care at all about this situation, reddit, or the moderators. I'm a pretty apathetic content sponge.\n\nThat fact is deadly dangerous to reddit, because the moment the content creators jump ship, I'll follow them like the fair weather fan I am, because I don't care -- at all -- where I get my content, or about which corporation or moderators are involved. If reddit compromises its content stream by having moderators jump ship, I'm out too, not because I care, but because I don't.\n\nSo she's right -- most reddit users absolutely don't care a bit about this, or the site, or really anything. And that's why she can't afford to piss off the moderators, who are the people who do care.\n\nWhat's hilarious is that the reddit administration seems unable to see that most people not caring is precisely what makes the moderators caring so dangerous: they're wielding my caring by proxy, because they hold the keys to content.\"\n\nthe systematic censorship of ideas on reddit is against it's fundamental principles  \nShe has no clue what Reddit is all about\nPenis equality for all\nEllen has poorly handled multiple situations in the short time she has been CEO.\nbring back victoria\nPao is a subpar CEO and is vastly unqualified to make decisions for a top tier website.\nA great site has horrible leadership and censorship.\nIt's a shame the leader of such an influential site doesn't respect the very members who support it. With her at the helm, surely reddit will wither and die.\nEllen Pao is running Reddit into the ground, she should resign before it's too late.\nI'm signing because I don't believe this woman should be able to lead a company that she doesn't fully understand. this isn't what reddit is about. I believe in free speech, reddit should be open for anything!!!!\nMore competent management\nI want reddit to remain the open forum it once was. \nI can't support a CEO that puts advertisers best interests before the community it was founded by.\nA CEO of a company should, at the very least, respect their product and its users. An employer should, at the very least, respect their employees enough to delegate them with fair treatment. A morally straight human being, at the VERY LEAST, should be understanding when a person is diagnosed with a terminal illness. Ellen Pao, please leave and never come back.\nI no longer support the actions of admins. They do not treat their userbase with any form of respect.\nreddit can be monetized efficiently. The current direction will kill the site.\nEllen Pao is bad for reddit, and bad for the internet.\nEllen Pao does not qualify for her position. .\nI'm signing to keep Reddit in the hands of the users.\nHe is a cunt\nShe's not fit to run this position.\nI want fatpeoplehate back\nKeep Reddit awesome remove Ellen Pao\nreddit has lost its luster under her heavy-handedness \nThis ceo is not running reddit with reddit in mind. She's running with money and personal gain in mind.... It's disgusting. \nit's the virtuous thing to do.\nDownward spiral for a beloved website since she has been in office.\nThe internet should not be censored even if you are offended.\nShe's inadequate for the job and does not deserve to be part of the reddit community \nShe's ruining a great sight and people's lifes.\nReddit is not going in the right direction.\nShe is destroying reddit \nShe sucks at her job\nI don't believe she has reddits best interest.\nI side with freedom of speech. \nI love REDDIT\nI believe Ellen will ruin reddit and I don't want that to happen.\nShe is ruining reddit.\nPao isn't fit to lead reddit. She doesn't know how it works and her leadership skills are questionable. \nFuck Ellen\nshe has single handily destroyed an amazing community\nReddit is a platform for expressing ideas and opinions, censorship has no place there. This outcome was inevitable once they started shutting down subreddits that offended people.\nEllen Pao embodies everything that is wrong with this world. I wish nothing but the worst for her.\nShe's creating a Reddit that I personally don't like. \nReddit deserves better.\nShe has proven to be out of touch with her user base. By commenting to newspapers and magazines before addressing the problems on her own job she proved this. Looking forward to another website to rise up and be the front page, that reddit is not anymore.\nI feel that Ellen Pao is a terrible person, and is ruining a site I have been an avid member of for years.\nI dunno, has Ellen Pao done anything but alienate the community?   Sometimes it's not what you do, but how you do it and this lack of transparency and communication is not the sign of a strong leader.  Please step down\nEither all of it is okay, or none of it is.\nEllen Pao is doing terrible things to Reddit.\nShe's ultimately responsible for the very poor handling of the situation. Pretty simple. \nPao is running Reddit into the ground\nno clarity\nThe seeming lack of care by the admins of Reddit lately is unacceptable and stupid.  You cannot properly run a website if you don't give a shit about what your users think.  It's also unacceptable to force people who want to actually help you run your site use a third party extension just because you're too lazy to update your site's UI in an actual meaningful way.  It also doesn't help that you don't take any feedback from your users on r/beta.  Don't get me wrong; I absolutely love Reddit.  But that's exactly why I can't stand to see what is being done to it; I don't want to see one of my favorite websites go down the drain and disappear.\nChairman Pao\nChairman Pao\nI'm signing this because the quality of Reddit has seriously declined in the past year. \nI want reddit to remain a free, open source of news, information, and perspective. \nEllen Pao essentially countermands the entire purpose of the website of which she is CEO. If an employee's beliefs are opposite those of the company, that employee has no place there, regardless of position or status.\ni think she is the cancer for reddit.com\nStop Ellen Pao from destroying the Reddit.com community by making her step down as CEO of Reddit Inc.\nReddit needs to be free\nFuck the paolice\nEllen has dismantled the free speech platform that Reddit was built upon\nFuck pao\nI do not like manipulative bitches who abuse tools meant for equality rather than personal advancement.\nEllen Pao is destroying Reddit.\ni hate Ellen k. Pao\nPeople should be able to say whatever they want\nbecause she sucks\nBitch I'm fabulous\nFuck ceo\nShe is a fraud and a terrible human being\nLet people who understand the internet run the website\nShe has no idea what the general population of Reddit wants or what it is about. \nPao is a PR nightmare and can not digg herself out of the shit-hole she has fallen into.\nEllen Pao is a cunt\nReddit either deserves to be run better or to die a graceless death.\nCunt\nEllen pao sucks I want more pictures of gene wilder\nThis bitch sucks\ncensorship sucks\nshes a cunt\nEllen Pao doesn't know what she is doing and needs to get out of Reddit\nreddit is better without her.\nI'm signing this because I love reddit and we need justice! \nShe needs to go. !!!\nI miss Reddit. Please fix this\nFuck this woman.\nBecause the internet should be a place to speak freely.\nReddit needs me\nIncompetent CEO destroying the best information share on the web.\nLurker here, voicing my opinion. \nI believe reddit should be an open forum supported by the community. I am against the 'cleaning up' of the community which has the clear intention of making the site more palatable for advertisers.\nAdolf Hitler \nFuck Kelly olynk\nOn top of so many worrying changes and consistent complaints from mods, that the CEO of Reddit failed to address the community directly tells me that this CEO doesn't understand Reddit, and doesn't want to be a part of it. \nShe needs to find a new job\nEllen Pao is ruining reddit. \nReddit is the last bastion for secure thought. Ellen Pao has demonstrated that she is a threat to this once safe medium.\nEllen Pao also broke the law, discriminating against a disabled worker.\nEllen Pao is an unsavory individual that is undeserving of her position as the interim chief executive officer of Reddit. \n\nOutside of Reddit, Ellen Pao is a crooked and egotistical individual that purposefully abuses and misconstrues the message of the feminist movement for her own personal gain. \n\nOn Reddit, she enacts extremely unpopular decisions with little to no communication with Reddit's user base, which recently includes the censoring of several subreddits and removal of a popular AMA admin.\nDue to the mismanagement if REDDIT and the firing of Victoria Taylor.\nGet out of here\nI am opposed to seeing a person who has previously manipulated the law and fabricated stories take the seat(any seat for that matter) at Reddit, a website I have up to this point been very fond of.\nShe's terrible\nellen pao must step down\nShe is a morally bereft human being who is setting the feminist agenda back by a number of years.\nBAN CENSORSHIP. WE DEMAND TRANSPARENCY FOR VICTORIA TAYLOR!\nSince taking the helm at Reddit, the site has slowly changed towards more aggressive censorship. Reddit has self moderated itself in the past and will continue to do so if allowed to do so. If the content is not explicitly illegal then it should be allowed. Open discussion of even the most controversial topics should be allowed on the site. Reddit can make its opinion on topics clear to the public, but that should not be forced on the users. \nCensorship is unacceptable.\nShe is a pest\nShe is cancer\nidk\nGet her out\nFuck That Bitch\nPao is a Natzi who wants to pussify the world with censorship.  REDDIT ARMY FO LYF MOTHERFUCKER!\nShes terrible. \nPAO! RIGHT IN THE KISSER! \nPao does not respect or deserve her position. She it taking advantage of her power to limit free speech and make a profit \nEllen Pao spit on my child\nDOWN WITH CENSORSHIP. DEMAND TRANSPARENCY ON AMA COORDINATOR VICTORIA TAYLOR!\nI believe in information being free and unobstructed. Ellen Pao has no clue what that means\nShe has proven to be an apathetic CEO\nFuck Ellen Pao\nbecause every little bit helps.\nThis woman made reddit suck \nReddit has been taken over by zionists and illuminati\nshe's a bad CEO\nEllen Pao has threatened a free internet with censorship.\nEllen Pao is moving in the wrong direction. Pao is poisoning the work environment for reddit employees and/or moderators. Pao is taking away everything that makes reddit special from its customers or users. Pao is causing reddit to be something that is uninspiring and boring. Pao does not appeal to the millenial generation and therfore is losing the biggest market segment using reddit. If Pao is not terminated I will be using chive and/or another competitor instead of reddit.\nI don't like the direction she's taking reddit\nI oppose the new censorship policy and how the admins are handling the community\nI doubt this will do anything in the end, but in the interest of giving a hoot, I can't just sit and watch reddit get ruined.\nThe site is dying and I will be very sad to see it go. The largest most detrimental changes can either be traced to her directly or were mishandled by her.\nPls go Ellen...\nShe has ruined the site that I once spent at least 4-8 hours a day on. (Depending on my work schedule)\nAny admin that wants to makes changes to the site I spent hours on a day, should have the decency to talk to us directly. My time is not to be sold and bought as a commodity like ellen believes we all are. I will leave reddit and take all my friends with me \nPao's attitude and decisions while CEO of Reddit show that she is out of touch with the user base and unsuitable for the position. The fact that she believes that because the vast majority of users don't care about the current events at Reddit and hasn't considered that Reddit is what it is due to the fact that the vocal minority, as she puts it, are the primary contributors of Reddit’s content, should be more than enough evidence to prove that she doesn't understand the very company she's been charged with managing.\nExecs has lost sight of customers/commodity \nI don't like the CEO and we will find a free speech platform.  \nElen pao is ruining my past time!!!!!\nToo many reasons, she is killing the site i love, a site she \"manages\" but doesnt even know how to use. \nShe is not fit to manage the community.\nshe is a criminal\nI do not like the direction this company is taking. I believe Pao to be detrimental to the overall success of reddit.\nShe needs to go now. \nBecause enough is enough, Pao.\nI'm signing this because I believe that Ellen Pao is in fact running a beloved website into the ground. She is sexist, censors for pay as opposed to believing in free speech, and has no interest in the continuation of the website she runs other than gaining profit and selling out anyone along the way. \n\nAdmins have not worked with moderators, have not communicated with moderators and redditors, and have not attempted to involve the people who actually run the website and the content into their \"plan\" for the future. Ellen Pao has drawn up so much controversy for her horrible decisions that she is not fit to run something so beloved by the world. I know a petition will not do anything to really change her mind since she is tyrannical and seems to have an identity of a \"victim, but I will stand by my own morals and for the majority. \n\nI may not agree with every persons' opinions but I will stand for everyone's right to say it. Ellen Pao does not, and only wants the title for for money, not to better something so many others have put their life, joy, tears, and excitement into. \nPao is a typical example of poor Silicon Valley leadership\nyou need to stop censoring random subreddits just because you feel like it.\nDown with Pao.\nTime to create a new, better reddit from the support of those mods that have made it such a success that it has attracted this situation. \nEllen Pao is a horrible individual\nI want my reddit back!!\nI'm signing this petition because Ellen Pao is ruining what used to be an amazing platform for free speech around the world.\nShe is ruining reddit.\nellen is destroying reddit as we speak!\nPao is corrupt and must go\nPao is out of touch with her user base and is not positively representing this company.\nThe site has gone downhill since she has started, RIP Victoria\nFuck Pao\nSomeone who doesn't understand what Reddit is should not be allowed to take over and attempt to ruin it.\nReddit was always a wonderful forum because of its adherence to the 1st amendment and the importance of free speech in our society.  Ellen K. Pao does not represent these ideals and should be removed immediately. \nShe is turning reddit into a business\nShe's evil.\nI believe that reddit should be free of censorship. \nim singing in an attempt to make reddit a better place and more for the users. no business tactics \ni didnt think reddit would really come together on this but you guys are really doing it, so heres me chipping in my opinion to the cause as well and i hope this makes a difference\nHow many closed subs, pissed off users, and negative articles is it going to take to send her packing.  She is completely out of touch with the community that she Oversees.\nI dislike how the direction she has decided to take this site recently.\nShe is ruining reddit\n\nI'm sick of censorship. The lies. The underhanded agenda of a woman who will sue anything that doesn't agree with her.\nellen pao is disconnected with the community and has failed as a leader. she has had numerous years to change the way reddit communicates with its users, and its admins but only has recently decided when the community threatens to leave to actually do something. She is a lawyer, not a leader. She cannot sue her way around reddit like the rest of her life.  She has yet to personally address reddit and only addressed one issue thru a newspaper. So much irony in the way she attempted to communicate through. \nReddit is founded on the principals of democracy and freedom of speech.  Without the democratic voting system or freedom to support the ideas you like, Reddit will fail just like Digg.  Ellen Pao does not understand that even though Reddit is owned by a corporation, it is not supposed to be run like one.  To do so destroys the principals that makes Reddit great.\nShe is making drastic changes to one of my beloved websites. \nI believe in free speech and that reddit is taking a turn for the worse. \nfuck ellen pao\nI'm signing because I do not agree with the changes that Pao has recently made to Reddit.\nBecause I love Reddit, and do not like what she is doing to it. \nI agree that Ellen Pao is unfit to lead Reddit. Either she resigns or I leave and encourage everybody I know to do the same.\nI want a reddit with no censorship\nReddit should remain censorship free and be run by its users if it is to remain. The takeover of advertisers and PR gurus will only drive users away.\nbecause this woman is ruining reddit.\nShe has transformed reddit from a bastion of free speech into a tool of corporations\nfreedom of speech was the one thing that made Reddit special, and abandoning that in the name of profit will eventually ruin reddit as a company. \nShe ruined the place. \nAs someone who has been a redditor for over 8 years since Ellen has been in charge the has been going down dramatically. I experienced the rise and fall of digg and don't want this to happen with reddit. \n\nTransparency is key.\nShe is hitler and obamas love child\nim signing because my friend feels very strongly about this\nReddit should not be monetized.\nthis site is not tumbler \nI just want a reddit that isn't filled with hate and private subs\nWhile things that are illegal are not smart to keep up, free speech should br. Honestly, in an age where yo can block, ban, and ignore anything,  anyone should be able to say anything online.\nThere are an overwhelming number of examples why she is not the correct person to be in her position for Reddit.\nSay no to censorship.\nI want reddit to stop going down the shitter\nEllen Pao not seem to have the interests of reddit's users at heart and has made no effort to show that this is not the case.\nshe a hoe\nEllen broke Wheaton's Law by firing the only employees that allowed the community to thrive.\nI want reddit back\nI'm signing this because I'm sick of seeing something I love destroyed for reasons that don't make sense. Ellen is not in the best long term health for reddit, so she needs to go.\nbecause fuck you pao\ngtfo ellen pao\nI believe pao is going to singlehandedly destroy a very important community and the wonderful things that it brings many people\nEllen Pao needs to be removed  from reddit. \nfuck pao\n\nPao does not represent what reddit once was: a bastion of free speech and integrity. \nReddit sucks, and she's not making it any better.\nReddit's quality has dropped since she was put in power\nBecause Poe has to go.\nI love Reddit and don't want AMA made into TMZ \nEllen Pao is destroying Reddit. It seems like she has never even been on the site and is singlehandedly burning it to the ground. She just isn't doing her job well and needs to go.\nReddit doesn't care about it's user base or mods.\nRunning Reddit into the ground.\nShe is ruining reddit \nShe is ruining the site I have grown to love. \nRather have free speech than not having hateful subreddits\nI do not agree with what pao is doing to reddit\nI do not agree with what pao is doing to reddit\nNo need for dictators online.\nI sincerely believe that Ellen Pao is ruining reddit. As one wise sage once said - \"Reddit is not going to end with a bang, it's going to end with a Pao\"\nYou're a manipulative, greedy, lying hack. Your actions WILL kill this community and this site. If the investors had even 1/4 of a brain right now, they'd be tearing down the walls for your head on a pike.\nI believe Mrs. Pao is bad for the Reddit community \nFor Ellen pao to step down as CEO of reddit . Have a good day!!\nEllen Pao is directly or indirectly allowing censorship of Reddit (supposed free speach platform) material.  \nPao is moving reddit away from the principles the site was built on. \nReddit should have free speech.\nPao is ruining reddit and also because i can \nFor science.\nCensorship \nI'm signing because I believe in free speech in an open forum. \nThe fact that she even made it to the CEO position astounds me with the hateful lawsuits she makes.\n\nPlus i want my dank memes back\nShe a hoe\nim signing because i do not like the direction reddit is going in\nReddit is in a state of turmoil, and it's clearly due to a lack of transparent management.\nLiterally Hitler.\ni don't like the direction reddit is heading in\nreddit.com used to be an informative site.  After Ms. Pao took charge, it began to become more noise than signal.  Much good content was banned.  Much bad content, too, but it isn't worth it.  A good resource has been ruined by greed.\nIt's extremely clear that Ms. Pao is completely out of touch with the reddit community as a whole, preferring to deflect issues and use misdirection to make herself seem more valuable to the company than she is.\nReddit sux\ni hate fat people\nI hate what Pao has done to my favorite website. I was fine with the initial censorship (/r/fatpeoplehate), but when she began to have posts removed because they were against her and her policies, she showed her true face. I believe that she has a god complex and that she will not stop until she has turned reddit.com into a discount tumblr.com, a place where free expression is only for the few and censorship reigns supreme.\nShe is the Donald Trump of Reddit\nI'll vote for change and if that doesn't work, I'll vote by dropping reddit for another site.  The fact I'm even writing this shows how much I actually care.  Normally I just stop going like I did with digg.com, fark.com etc.\nEllen Pao sucks\nEllen Pao is literally hitler. \nI'm signing because Reddit has always been a place of free speech and has been virtually free of mass corporate influence. Pao has attempted to usher in a new Reddit era full of corporate influence, to make the site profitable and investor friendly. But in doing so, she's effectively strangling the life from the site, in an attempt to make money. She's been completely inept at effectively running the company, as well as creating profits for it. \nEllen Pao needs to go, if you don't love your product why be there? oh yea, money... ugly woman.\nI agree with the rest of reddit\nfuck\nReddit was the dream of a good man.\nFuck censorship\nREDDIT NEEDS IT'S FREEDOM BACK!\nFuck pao\nyou're a dumb bitch\nEllen Pao is literally hitler \nEllen Pao is a fraud!\nI can't trust in the leadership of Ellen Pao\nEllen Pao is destroying Reddit.\nI want reddit to stay the free and thriving community it was before Ellen Pao came along.\nI'm signing because I believe Pao doesn't care for the community she is in charge of and I do not support her decisions.\ni am signing because I want normal reddit back\nbring back chooter\nWhile Pao is undoubtedly just a symptom of a unfortunate shift in reddit's management, this petition serves as an excellent statement on behalf of its user base.\nEllen Pao is the worst\nShe is a politically correct fascist firing all who dare ask questions inconvenient for liberal sacred cows.\n\nFuck her.\nI'm signing because Ellen Pao is fighting for herself under the guise of gender equality\nEllen Pao is ruining my day\nshes ruining everything :(\nI want reddit to go back to normal\nShe is awful. Free Reddit from this horrible \"CEO\".\nI'm signing because if she's still there I will find a new reddit If she stays.\nVictoria has her place at Reddit.\nStep down you fool.\nreddit must be restored to its functional state\nCensoring is not okay.\nI'm signing because Pao should resign. She does not have the best intentions for Reddit.\nFuck Ellen poa\nI think there might still be a chance to save reddit. Might.\nEllen Pao is ruining reddit. I know i will be leaving soon if she stays in charge, inconsiderate bitch\nShe's a moron.\nIf I inform my opinion of ellen pao based her recent legal debacle, then it is my true belief that she is ill suited to her roll as CEO of Reddit, a company that looks to its community and has receded in its commitment to their common ideologies.\nEllen Pao is the worst. \nEllen Pao has done nothing good for the Reddit community or the website itself. She has gotten some of the best people on that website and it something she should regret. As a regular user of the website, ever since she has become CEO, the site slowly has gotten worse overtime and as of the recent past months, she is killing reddit and almost all of the community can agree. Ellen Pao needs to step down and ruining a website she knows nothing about.\nim signing because I would rather not leave reddit, however I will follow the original content wherever it ends up\nTaking away our free speech at Reddit. Last I checked this is AMERICA not some communist society. \nI am signing because I am a 7 years+ reddit user. I need to make sure that the reddit that I love will remain independent and free. \nIm signing because I want Ellen Pao removed as CEO of reddit. \nThe Reddit administration has no respect for its staff, and least of all for its users.\ni am not happy with the direction reddit is going.\nThis is nothing personal against her.  Reddit has made some terrible decisions and ultimately someone must be accountable.\nFor the greater good\nMrs. Pao should not lead Reddit because she does not understand community driven content creation. \nCensorship on a website like Reddit ruins Reddit\nI want reddit to thrive and be a free platform \nEllen Pao is ruining Reddit and she must be removed as CEO as soon as possible.\nThe path I see reddit take is a path I won't longer be on. \nReddit is only as good as the people who put effort into it.  With the lack of transparency from the Reddit Admin team to it's moderators we could lose the very people who make Reddit a great.  Without the community this is just another website.\nBecause this is something that matters to me.\nMs Pao is not qualified to be the CEO of anything.\nI would like to see Ellen pao resign. She has ruined Reddit within the past couple of months. \nEllen Pao does not understand her consumers.\nI don't like what she's done to the site.\nPao is managing reddit to it's demise.\nShe has destroyed the reddit I fell in love with. \nI do not believe Ellen Pao is a good leader for the website reddit. \nI agree with what this petition is trying to achieve \nShe is not fit to run this company.\nDAE HATE ELLEN PAO\nShe is out of touch with Reddit.\nBecause fuck you, that's why.\nEllen Pao has no idea what she's doing\nreddit told me to\nEllen Pao is ruining reddit. \nShe is ruining the freedom of reddit. \nEllen Pao's management on reddit is just horrendous. She should step down\nThe front page of the Internet deserves better\nI Believe in a Free internet and a free Reddit\nThis whole situation seems particularly sketchy and I don't understand why reddit hired this person in the first place.\nPao is ruining reddit, she will turn it into digg or something worse\nI think reddit as a company needs to change and Pao will have to go\nI don't want my favourite websites fucked with.\nPao must go! She's a disaster for Reddit.\nI think that the current CEO is detrimental to the values and freedom our communnity has previously upheld\nEllen has gone far enough with destroying reddit \nI disagree with Pao's decisions.\nFuck Ellen K. Pao\nFuck her\nThis woman lacks leadership skills needed to run Reddit, isn't able to take criticism without turning into a dictator, has a very shady person life and lawsuit. Most importantly she doesn't understand the company she runs or the user base of Reddit. Reddit advertises itself as a platform for free-speech. I may not like racist or fat hating subreddits, but removing these undermines Reddit's sole purpose and missiion. The firing of Victoria is another reason. For a woman who claism to be a politcal correct social justice warrior and was \"wrongly terminated\" is quite the hypocrite when she isn't trying to scam a business out of 2.7 million dollars because she tried banging her way to the top.Kleiner Perkisn was right, she lacks leadership skills.\nShe needs to go, period\nWe need to change Reddit, and i know it goes beyond Pao to change the whole culture of a country but this is the first step we must take. Together we can!\nPao has completely changed Reddit. Freedom of speech is no longer a tenant of Reddit, nor is transparency. You can choose to get rid of her or me, which it is?\nI was told there would be punch and pie.\nI'm signing because this site has a very diverse community and the company behind the site are slowly mismanaging the site into a state that is no longer enjoyable. They are quickly putting profits as a priority instead of slowly building a sustainable and profitable method to grow the site. \nI don't agree with her policy's\nEllen is hurting Reddit, she doesn't understand us, and she is trying to change the very foundation in which Reddit was founded on. Many of us are planing to migrate to an alternative site if she doesn't go.\nI'm signing because I care about this website and have seen a decline in quality during Ms. Pao's tenure.\nreddit is shit\nI want to save reddit\nShe has a record of being a bitch to her employers and employees. Tired of hearing abound her dumb shit on reddit and want her gone. \nbring back FPH\nI want my old reddit back and this seems to be the best way.\nI don't want these cretins coming to 4chan. Get rid of the lady they all hate or whatever.\nI'm tired of the drama surrounding her on Reddit. It takes away from the website to login and keep seeing it spammed with Ellen Pao hate.\nI feel Ellen Pao's time as CEO of reddit has been negative for the site.\nEllen needs to go.\nShe is destroying what I love. \nDislike Ellen Pao as the CEO\nShe stifles free speech.\nellen pao sucks\nWWDD\nPao is destroying reddit!\nReddit is a community, and even though you are the CEO you are doing everything possible to not be a part of that community, and are infact seemingly set on it's destruction. I am sure that there is much worse you could still do, but it is probably best to step down before that happens.\nEllen Pao has abused her power in silencing free speech on such a beautiful and powerful website. It doesn't matter what people say just that they have their right to say it. Please remove her. \nEllen Pao is a monster. \nI believe in the right to free speech. \nI feel that Ellen Pao has made poor decisions that have been detrimental to Reddit and will continue to do so.\nShe seems to either lack understanding of what makes reddit appealing or she simply doesn't care. Either way I'm looking for alternatives. I have little interest in a \"sanitized\" exchange of ideas.\nI'm signing because I miss the community that reddit was before Pao took over. \nI like poopie.\nThe way reddit is being run. \nBecause profit is the antithesis of creativity and freedom.\nShe sucks\n\nThe internet should not be censored. \nEveryone else is doing it and I don't want to be left out...\nEllen Pao is a joke.\nI do not like censorship on reddit. But Pao is an okay person and I send nothing but love. \nreddit is NOTHING without us, your actions have shown a total disregard for the mods that RUN YOUR SITE. you are not in touch with the community of reddit at all.\nfk ellen pao\nEllen Pao doesn't understand Reddit and its unique community and is only interested in her own visions. She doesn't deserve to be CEO for such an awesome site.\nFREEDOM\nI'm signing because Ellen Pao is not the right person to lead the foremost embodiment of democracy on the internet.\nReddit is the site I use the most and do not want it to deteriorate.\nShe has a smelly vagina?\nReddit needs a CEO that can foster growth for the company while keeping the user base in mind. \n/u/FlareonTheProphet\nReddit is a vast community based website that can do so much better without the tacky intervention by Pao, and with proper communication between Reddit admins and moderators. The drastic increase in the amount of admins who left after Pao stepped in is proof enough that something is definitely wrong here.\nPao is ruining the internet\nOur voice needs to be heard as consumers who care about the open information of Reddit.\nI'm signing this because I can see you're turning reddit into digg.  \nI'm signing because Reddit has been terrible since she stepped up.\nEllen Pao is taking reddit in the wrong direction \nThe lulz\nOne person should not be allowed to destroy thousands of communites because of greed and incompetence. It's time for her to go. \nreddit needs to get back to basics - censorship is no place for this community \nThis person is toxic, power hungry, and incompetent as a business decision maker. Pao is a major detriment to Reddit as a business entity, and an avenue for free expression. \nThis woman should not and clearly cannot run reddit\nReddit has gone downhill because of her\nPao has to go\nVictoria was awesome. Letting her go is the beginning of the end for Reddit. \nI'm not happy with the current mismanagement of reddit\nneeds to happen\nReddit told me to\nI'm signing because Pao is a dictator who doesn't care about the community she's supposed to serve. She is Pao Pot.\nellen pao is a cunt\nThis woman is retarded. \nI'm signing because I want the old reddit back.\nshe's terrible\nEllen pao is ruining my favorite website\ndo not want to see reddit end up like digg\nShe only seems to make things worse.\nShe's allowing Reddit to nosedive entirely based on her ideology. \nShes poop at this job\nShe has not provided the leadership that Reddit deserves. She has engaged in PR rather than actually addressing the issues.\nEllen Pao doesnt represent reddit ideologies.\nEllen Pao is destroying the Reddit website.  She has to go, or the whole thing will collapse.\nEllen Pao needs to step down.\nReddit has been my digital home for a very long time, and I want the best for it. Ellen Pao's leadership has done bad things for the community I've liked for so long.\nCEOs who don't know what they were hired to run suck ass.\nReddit was created to avert censorship in big communities, and it's now failing its purpose.\nI don't think she deserves to be a CEO.   The reddit community is much stronger than her and it will be proven by this petition.\n\n                                                                                                                                                        \nThe value of the company is not reddit software or the administration of reddit, the value is user's willingness to participate on the platform.  Her actions and unawareness of the value of the community is diminishing the value of the company, possibly beyond repair.\nI am signing this petition because I do not want my favorite website in the hands of somebody that does not seem to care about reddit or its community.\nThe internet needs to stay free and open. Reddit is a website that aids in that pursuit, however, no progress will be made with Ms. Pao in power.\nPao is the worst thing to happen to Reddit\nCEOs that don't understand the company are bad.\nShe is ruining the reddit community \nstep down Ellen\nim signing because Ellen pao is changing the free speech reddit that I loved into a censored site. She's also a cunt\nayy lmao dank memes fuck ellen pao\nEllen Pao is cancer\nEllen Pao lacks the fundamental understanding of her company to properly run it for the benefit of its long-term health.\nMrs Pao is a terrible woman. And she is making this website terrible. She NEEDS to leave.\nI'm signing because she isn't a good CEO\nWhen there's smoke, there's fire. Pao is smokier than the mountains in Tennessee. \nYOU ARE RUINING REDDIT\nLet's be honest, she doesn't understand how and what Reddit is; What Reddit used to be  if she remains in charge. She rather go to another \"Media Source\" and make a statement regarding this issue? instead of addressing Reddit itself? That makes perfect sense /s I'm just a lurker but I cannot stand how she is trying to change Reddit. Many have fallen before but in their ashes what \"Reddit\" Stands for will rise. you cannot change it.  \nShe should have used Reddit to make her official response.\nfire the ceo\nI just want Reddit back to the way it used to be. Frankly, I don't quit like the very harsh backlash against a human being, but she really has been ruining the Reddit I've come to love. Although, if she does choose to stick her course, someone else will only come up with a site that provides the entertainment Reddit once did and Reddit will be barren. Then she will realize she caused it's downfall and for what?\nbring back yishan \n\n/s\nFire her!!\nShe's running the site into the ground\nShe has handled this situation very poorly, and doesn't seem to understand reddit. She I don't like how she interviews, gives a really bad first impression.\nI believe in free speech\nReddit has always been a haven for free speech. And yes, even supposedly \"hateful\" speech should be protected. Please remember, at one point saying that slaves should be freed was considered \"hateful\" throughout much of the United States. At one point saying that women should be allowed to vote would have been considered \"hateful.\" Instead of dictating from on high which speech is acceptable and which is not, try letting the marketplace of ideas function: bad ideas do eventually get pushed down and good ideas do get pushed up.\n\nShe's the wrong man for the job.\nCensorship is deplorable and Ellen Pao actively uses it as a tool to silence her dissenters. \nI don't like her comment about the majority not being interested. I've stopped looking at Reddit because of her attitude and comments\ndon't sue me \nEllen Pao is unfit to be the CEO of reddit.com. \nSince she has become CEO, the sight i have loved for some time has been falling apart slowly.\nto stop communism \nReddit is falling apart and it's no good.  \nIm signing because ellen pao is doing a wonderful job running reddit....right into the ground.\nStep down now!!\nEllen Pao is a cunt\nIt's the right thing to do. \nI love Reddit and Ellen is killing it.\nUtter respect to the community\nIts for the good of the people\nA CEO should not be able to actively mock their client base without retaliation.\nCAUSE OF THAT SHIT\nChairman Pao has to go\nActions taken by this CEO has caused the entirety of the Reddit community to divulge into chaos. She was brought in to foster improvement to the site, but has only dismantled what good things it had going for it and has ultimately tarnished its reputation.\n\nThe best action the Reddit board could do now is have Pao step down, reverse all of her terrible decisions, and replace her with someone more experienced with the Reddit community and has a better understanding of its founding ideals.\nYou can't stamp out an idea\nShe doesn't care about the platform or community.\nI don't agree with censorship \nClear mismanagement of job - how did this person qualify for their job?  Certainly not CEO material - questionable business acumen.\nI'm signing  because Ellen K. Pao looks like a demented horse.\nPao appears to be trying to suppress the very essence of what makes Reddit great, free thought and speech.  \nFor the sake of Reddit - we need you gone Pao!!!\nReddit shouldn't even have a CEO. Reddit is by the people and for the people. An administrative group is completely unnecessary to the functioning of Reddit. A hands off administration is one thing; an Ellen Pao who wants to change things is a disaster.\nI'm signing because Ellen Pao is not suited to be the CEO of Reddit.\nShe must resign or the whole site will colapse.\nI NEEDED Reddit to be free so I can receive the content to stay up to date.\nI want the banned subreddits back.\nI'm signing because there is no place in the world for people who hate their product and their consumers. \nIt is obvious from her actions that Pao is ONLY interested in reddit users and staff as long as she can profit off them. The reddit Aaron Shwartz created is long dead. \"People\" like Pao are why we can't have nice things. \nEllen has done counter productive decision to the well-being of reddit. She has a horrible track record with being a terrible manager, and continues to show utter disdain towards the community and bullheads her own agenda onto everyone else.\nI like reddit\nI hate this person who is destroying reddit\nshes not that awesome.\nggggg! ggg? ggggg\nGet her out!\nEllen Pao its not a suitable CEO for reddit \nFucking Pao Zedong\nI'm signing this because I believe in free speech.\nWe do care. \nI am dissatisfied with Reddit since Pao became CEO.\nI go with the masses\nShe needs to go.\nShe's The Wrong Person For The Job\nI really don't like corporate fascists.  We need more people like Victoria who can do the job without the entitlement.\nfuck ellen pai\ni don't want censorship and dictator like control to ruin the open forum that used to be Reddit.\nfuck censorship\nShes ruining reddit!\nAfter watching interviews and and reading about Ellen. It's clear the type of person she is is not one that has her company or customers best interest at heart. \nI hate censorship more than I hate morons.\nReddit has been my favorite site for over 4 years. In the past few months the site has taken a nose dive as all of the things it once believed in are being tossed to the side. The entire purpose of reddit is that it's a community driven forum, when you lose focus on the original foundation, you'll lose everything you've accomplished thus far. I doubt this will even be read, but it's worth contributing my thoughts on the matter. \nbecause I believe in a powerful community without her ruining it\nShe's awful but fat people hate still needs to be censored \nbecause I agree derp\nThe quality of Reddit is diminishing \nI'm signing this because I do believe in the necessity of change within the company of reddit; especially the position of Reddit's CEO\nPeople shouod not be able to take an office and abuse their powers. Reddit was made for people to be themselves not to be directed by a dictator.\nLet's get reddit back\nI think firing Victoria without warning was the wrong thing to do.\nI don't believe in how Reddit is currently run as a company. \nBecause Pao is a great example of a really horrible person.  Censorship and lies are what she stands for.\nfuck 'er\nCensorship and Victoria \nA wonderful time to show the world she isn't as evil as people make her out to be, yet her actions so far have only confirmed it. People like her need to be stood up to, even if only a small signing of a petition is all one individual can do.\nI'm signing because Reddit has become a vital part of my life and of the Internet as a whole. Like other private services like Google search and Craigslist, Reddit has no obligation to me to continue providing their service. However, it is a loss to me and to Internet users to have such an invaluable community be tampered with in such an insensitive and uninformed way as Ellen Pao has done.\nI believe she is not the best direction for Reddit \nshes ruining reddit. \nMy friend asked me to.\nBring Victoria back.\nI'd like the website I spend the most of my time on to not be ran into the ground. \nIm signing because reddit has changed in recent months. The content has fallen off due to the outrage caused by the reddit ceo. Whether her leadership has been poor or not, it has led to outrage which is ruining the site for me and nearing my abrupt termination of its use. \nA CEO should not treat their company like this. \nA leader should listen to his or her subordinates, customers, advisors, etc. She is a poor example of what a leader should be.\nEllen Pao is ruining the reddit community.\nI am signing this petition because I wish reddit to remain as it has always been .... a forum individuals can go to learn and communicate with others on various topics without worrying about censorship.  What is going on within Reddit is very unfortunate. \nfor the lolz\nGetting rid of Victoria is an unfair and personally biased decision.The community was better thanks to her.\ni think reddit would be better without her \nShe is out of touch.  How she even got this job is beyond me.\nVictoria \nPOWER TO THE PEOPLE!!! \nI'm sick of seeing this shit all over reddit. \nI want to see someone who's emotionally invested in Reddit in charge. \nI don't want reddit to fail as a website and as a community. Something or someone needs to change.\nPao is not capable of properly running a website as big as reddit and should step down\nAsain\nFuck ellen\nWe need to stop Ellen Pao from destroying Reddit. \nI don't think Ellen Pao is the sole problem in regards to how Reddit is being run, but removing her would be beneficial to the site's future. \nfuck this cunt\nEllen Pao is destroying my favorite website\nThis woman is not capable of leading a drunk choir, let alone a social networking company\nCensorship is not compatible with reddit. \nBecause Ellen K Pao has overstepped her boundaries and has made it clear she doesn't care about Reddit's community.\npeer pressure\nI think she is slowly tearing apart reddit and clearly doesn't care how the majority of the users feel about her actions\nEllen Pao is ruining my safe space\nEllen pao is evil\nWe speak in numbers\nEllen is ruining my favorite website \nReddit needs to wake up. As Steve Job once said as one of the greatest CEO of one of the greatest company of all time, if there was a time if he was unable to do his job, he will step down. Now it is time for Ellen K. Pao to do the same. \nTransparency, freedom of expression, and respect for the mods/users is what led reddit to be great in the first place.\ngoddamn it Pao\nFUCK PAO\nFuck censorship.\nEllen Pao does not understand reddit and is not fit to lead it. \nEllen Pao's ideals are not the same that Reddit's community needs\nReddit should be open and free, like wikipedia. It can't be with it's focus on monetization and censorship rather than quality content. I don't trust Ellen Pao.\nEllen pao is a fuckwit\nReddit has taken a nose dive under her leadership. Return reddit to its roots.\nReddit exists as a nest where all people from all walks of life can come together, share ideas, be inspired, or come and be enriched with knowledge. For many years I have seen the birth and deaths of many subreddits, care and guess who gave the say? The members of the reddit community, they the upvoters have said that they don't want a page like this and simply ignore it and let it shrive away  never to be see again. Yet Mrs. Ellen Pao decides to completely decimate this long going tradition of letting the people decide what they want to see. Is this to say that some of these   subreddits weren't offensive? In no way am I saying that, but it should be noted that some of those were thriving subreddits with hundreds of thousands of users. Mrs Pao being from and investment capital background should at the very least have noted that the same rule of economics can be applied to the reddit community. The question is why change a great and successful recipe which people love and enjoy? Why fire an employee that serve the very purpose of carving and polishing the sites crown jewel? One who has had a major impact upon the community and helped in pushing this site even higher on the most popular site lists and scales. It appears that ulterior motives and a desire to displace rage onto something or someone is at fault, but until otherwise I have come to believe that Mrs. Ellen Pao is incompetent and unable to serve reddit as interim CEO due to a lack of fundamental understanding of the site and its users work, interact, and coexist in the vast world of content which is the internet  \nI believe that Pao should step down.\nI want reddit to be a place for free and open discussion not for corporate invasion. \nShe's a bad CEO\n[REDACTED]\nI'm signing because Ellen Pao threatens the existence of my favorite website.\nHer actions are inexcusable. \nThis woman, though she may be a very nice person in her personal life, has shown by her actions that she is unwilling to put what's good for this community above her own interests.  She should step down.\nI don't think the internet should be censored\nThe need for censorship is non existent. Pao needs to step down or move over and allow for the company we all love to be run as it should be. \nI believe Pao is driving Reddit into a negative direction. The way it is going the community will move to a different website. I am voting because I love Reddit.\nShe and her husband are con artists who have no business being in control of anything. She has no applicable experience for such a position and she has done an inexplicably horrible job. I'm deeply disappointed in how the site has been run in the past months.  I'm appalled by the blatant commercialization of the site and censorship of free flowing ideas.  This is not the reddit I came to so many years ago.  It has changed for the worse and unless there is a fundamental change in the way this site is managed, I will be leaving.\nellen pao has ruined my favorite website.\nWhy wont she/they tell us what's going on?\nI don't agree with the changes Ellen Pao has implemented to reddit.Com and strongly feel that she is not an effective CEO.\nShe's a fucking sellout\nFuck Pao\nI am sick of censorship, SJWs, and political correctness ruining my internet experience. Resign.\nI believe Ellen Pao is the wrong leader for an important internet community such as Reddit.\nShe needs to go. \nI care about reddit and Ellen Pao is a thundercunt\nShe needs to step down\ni am a cat\ni don't agree with a crook, liar, and thief as the ceo of reddit\nEllen Pao has done nothing but worsen the community and wellbeing of the site I have loved and used daily for 3 years. It's very upsetting and disappointing.\nStep down!\nFuckPao\nToo much intervention, no respect for users.\nShe is a bad person\nReddit has become quite a mess in recent months, and many things point to it being her fault. Even if it's not ALL her fault, she seems to have no idea how to deal with the reddit community. \nEllen is ruining the front page of the internet through blatant manipulation and lies.\nellen pao is a weirdo\nWhile Ellen Pao is only a symptom of the larger issues at Reddit, she is certainly a very large symptom, and is not a good fit for the position of CEO.\nFuck Ellen Pao\nVictoria\nI'm signing because it's very clear Ellen Pao does not fully grasp what is at the heart of reddit. I have never seen a CEO of a company come into a community they know nothing about, and then try to change it completely. She has mocked us at every step and will be the downfall of this website. She needs to be replaced.\nFUCK ELLEN PAO SHE SUCKS\nI'm bored.\nYishan Wong has NEVER made so many controversial blunders in his career.  I've never even HEARD of his name in fact - because he never fucked up big.  I do know he was extremely thoughtful about all issues, including that of free speech - stress which has perhaps contributed to his stepping down.\n\nBut Ellen Pao: I know this name, and I see it over and over and over again because reddit is heading towards destruction under Ellen's thoughtless and unfairly biased actions.  Ellen does not share the virtues that Reddit agrees with, nor does she uphold her own virtues in a fair and just manner.  Therefore, I suggest she step down for somebody of better ethical quality.\n\nReddit is a social thing.  Having a leader with the right ideals is of utmost importance - moreso than a simple tech company or a business for profit.  Once again it is important that the leader should have ideals, but that the leader must also have the RIGHT ideals.\nThe Internet shouldn't be censored \nI'm signing because Ellen Pao isn't fit for anything other than factory work.\nShe can't run a company or communicate to her user base. \nI've been a redditor for about 6 years and I don't want to see the site run into the ground. \nI believe in reddit being a platform for free expression and speech. \nReddit deserves better\nI'm signing because we need people that care about Reddit to run Reddit.\ndown with Ellen Pao\nCensorship is getting out of hand\nEllen is a cunt. \nStep down!\nWe need to take reddit back!\nReddit user pierricbross. \nellen pao is a cunt\ni do not like her\nSHES OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE COMMUNITY \nEllen is ruining Reddit\nbitch\nI love freedom of speech!\nEllen Pao has a history of ruining companies. Reddit is her latest victim. It's okay to grow Reddit as a more marketable business, and you should, but Ellen is clearly not the one to lead this growth. \nPao has ruined reddit and so has reddit.\n\nReddit has fucked reddit, good job guys, I loved this place but you fucked it.\n\nThanks Pao, your worse than hitler or mao or stalin all combined.\n\nYou sjw money whore.\nAaron Swartz would be rolling in his grave if he saw this cunt running his site. \nPao is an awful person\nu suck ellen pao\nCunt pao chicken is bad for us all\nI support free speach on the Internet. \nEllen Pao is destroying everything the Reddit community has built in the name of profit. Unfortunately, alienating the userbase that LITERALLY RUNS YOUR COMPANY is a really, really dumb idea.\n\nGo away.\nYou know why.\nThis CEO doesn't understand her brand or her consumers. She is charting a course so contrary to its own wonderful juvenilia. \ni hate this punch able face\nPao needs to go. This is ruining reddit\nEllen K Pao is a doo-doo head.\nHow the hell did she even get this job? \nCeo is not in touch with community\njaime reddit\nShe is very unprofessional\nEllen Pao is a fucking cunt. A sad kunt and she is trying to make it so that we all don't make it. We were all witnesses.\nEllen Pao is out of touch\n'...the vast majority of Reddit users are uninterested in what unfolded over the past 48 hours...' [sic]  Like most below average CEO varieties, an unextraordinary person in an extraordinary position, Chairman Pao has unsuccessfully attempted to gaslight and minimize the situation at hand; this lends credence to claims of her inability to hold in competence her current interim post. Who hired her, and why?!\nI do what the mass tell me. \nI hate petitions but exceptions are always made\nReprehensible behavior, transparent greediness, and aloof to the community.  If you're involved with the company, it needs to be much further down the ladder out of the spotlight, without so much power.\nThis might be the last chance we habe to save reddit\nDuh. Get a CEO who cares about their consumers.\nasdasd\nBecause FUCK PAO\nI'm signing because I am not okay with Chairman Pao being the interim CEO of what was once an honest, good company. \nEllen Pao is running Reddit into the ground. \nEllen Pao needs to LEAVE\nPao is satan.\nShe does not deserve to be there \nThose who desire to trample on the speech of of those they disprove should not be the CEO of a website that promotes free speech.\nHer blatent disregard for the reddit user base is appalling and will ruin a great site of not changed. \nI see no changes. Wake up in the morning and I ask myself,\n\n\"Is life worth living? Should I blast myself?\". Remove Ellen Pao from power so I no longer have to ask myself these things.\nI'm not living in NAZI Germany yet Pao must go\nPlease do the right thing and step down. Focus on yourself and family. \nI am a shitlord and this Pao cunt banned /r/fatpeoplehate.\n\nSay NO to censorship!\nI'm signing because I don't believe in censorhip. And also because of Victoria's wrongful termination.\nI disagree with censoring \"The Front Page of The Internet\".  You have something amazing.  Stop wasting it.\nPao is not a CEO, she is a bad hitler wannabe.\nReddit was a place to go and not worry about censorship and being community driven. Pao is changing that and running Reddit into the ground.\nShe is changing reddit for the worse\nPao is driving the people away who make reddit worth visiting, the content contributors and moderators. She has a very nasty personality that comes across even when she's on her best behavior in front of a camera. Please don't let her kill reddit. Send her packing. \njust because\nI'm not sexist but Ellen Pao is a total bitch.\nThis woman is toxic to the community and should step down effective immediately.\nI don't believe that she's doing the job that she should be, Trying to monetize the website because her frivolous lawsuit to extort money from her previous employer fell through. If she really wants to help her criminal husband repay the millions he stole from investors, go work the streets at night, honey, stop trying to ruin a good company for your own personal benefit.\nThe quality of service has declined under her helm.\nFuck Ellen Pao\nI want her to see the anger in everyone  and what the moderators have to deal with.\nCannot stand this woman being the lead of a platform I love. It's either her or me to go.\nI'm signing because Reddit deserves proper leadership.\nReddit needs a new CEO!\n\nI feel this particular person doesn't represent what Reddit originally started out to be. I have no issue with monetizing Reddit, it would be stupid not to, but the way in which she has chosen to do so hurts the community.\nI want Reddit to remain a place of free speech and I don't want Ellen Pao to mismanage my favorite website out of existence.\nShe is a toxic individual.\nEllen Pao sucks\nPao has a reputation of runing reddit and lying. \nIt is time for a change we can believe in. \nShe has shown that she is not capable of handling the responsibilities her job requires.\nI browse reddit for a lot of reasons. I like it.

She does understand reddit the way we need a CEO to understand it. If she has any moral compass whatsoever, she'll stand down.\nI like reddit, and I don't want to see it destroyed.\nThe fact that they censored reddit by removing fat people hate and the unwarranted firing of the woman behind the AMAs\nI see news on reddit 12-24 hours before I ever see it on HuffPo, Gawker, and days before it hits CNN, MSNBC, or Fox News. She has run the source of so much news into the ground.\n4 chan\nI love reddit and want to see it live so my child can also love reddit.\nI don't agree with the path reddit is on.\nEllen Pao is not taking any desires of her userbase into consideration.

To change that inherent nature is to destroy that nature, much as to command love or charity is to destroy these as well.  Ellen Pao's goals evident in the direction of the changes she, and her employees, have affected upon the site are admirable, but the very idea of making those changes is counter to the existence of Reddit.\nShe is not a good person nor does she have good intentions for reddit. \nIf she continues, this will never end. Reddit will become a black hole of a company. \n...Ellen Pao is clearly out of touch with the core Reddit user base. \nBitch is a cunt, needs to be removed, cancer cancer cancer, etc.\nShe aho\nHow now brown cow Pao\nI don't believe that she really supports her redditor's, she apologised to a magazine to them instead of addressing them directly.\nPao needs to step down. These actions have been absolutely outrageous, and Reddit functions best under free speech and equal footing. It's a slippery slope, at the end of the day.\nI believe CEOs should love their company and their customers\nI believe Reddit needs more support from its administrators.

A vast majority of the Reddit community believes that Pao, \"a manipulative individual who will sue her way to the top\", has overstepped her boundaries and fears that she will run Reddit into the ground. ... Action must be taken to prevent Reddit from being further run into the ground.\nI don't believe Ellen Pao is a fit leader of any organization. \nfuck her \nThe way she handled the whole situation is outrageous.

From a public relations standpoint, her ongoing decisions and actions seem to be undermining the attempts to bring the platform mainstream.

Censorship completely ruins this website. While I may not agree with the ideas behind every single subreddit, it is important to me that  everyone has the freedom to view and submit the content they want. Ellen Pao has demonstrated since becoming CEO of Reddit that she has no desire to uphold freedom of speech on this website. For that reason alone I believe she is not fit to serve as the CEO of Reddit Inc.\nI feel like Ellen Pao is not doing her job properly used lawsuits to get her position\nOf Ellen Pao.\nshe has ruined reddit\nFREE SPEECH BABY.\nPao has done more harm than good to the reddit community \nShe is the very essence of what the sight is not about.\nShe is ruining reddit.com \nEllen Pao needs to be let go.\nVictoria\nshe is ruining reddit.

It is unconscionable what she has done so far and I fear what she will do next.\nI feel free speech is important in public forums. Under Pao's watch free speech has come under attack on Reddit. \nReddit deserves a CEO that understands its user base and respects their ideals. The censorship that has happened, the random shadowbanning, the removal of subreddits without clear explanation, would not be happened if a competent CEO were in charge.\nEllen cares more about monetizing Reddit than she does about what makes Reddit worthwhile - the personal and personable involvement of its admins, the power of its moderators, and the free, uncensored expression of its users.\nI do no think her leadership is good for reddit.\nReddit needs to be saved!\nEllen Pao is a raging cuntasaurus rex\nempty promises from her, no apology offered \nI've been using Reddit for about 2 years now, and recently the site has been going downhill.

The site is changing at the expense of the users. The company may be trying to monetize, but if they lose the users there will be nothing left to monetize\nThe reddit community deserves better.\nit seems true that there was some censorship recently \nI resigned as a moderator earlier this year because of the complete and utter contempt the administrators of this site view their users. \n\nVolunteer hours of your time to help work on the site? Cool story bro, hope you like an inept user interface and administration that are more concerned with increasing profitability than making any meaningful improvements to the website. \n\nReddit has a whole host of problems, and Pao's removal is a good first-step toward resolving them. \nEllen pao is a dictator \nEllen Pao is anti freedom of speech \nShe has ruined Reddit, so many sub-reddits are gone, the numbers have dropped and subreddits are blacking out.

Pao's vision for the site does not allow for this. Community is more important then profit when it comes to sites like this.\nReddit has been going downhill recently. It has gone from a site that allowed users to discuss all matters to suddenly being tons of censorship and banning. I have seen this site grow for the past 5 years and this is the worst state it has been in and if it keeps going like this, many users and I will be migrating to better sites, where its more about the users.\nShes an awful CEO and is ruining reddit\nI hate what she is doing to Reddit. It is absolutely ruining the experience of something so beautiful. \nThe leader of a pack must understand the packs mindset otherwise there is no trust.\nI do not want to experience another Digg.\nTo help prevent internet censorship\nshes a controlling bitch\nI saw this at number 3 on the front page of reddit and Im sick of seeing posts about this stuff. I want my Reddit back!\n\"Chairman pao\" seems like a greedy press mongerer with interests only for herself and admins, not catering to the bulk of the traffic she owes her paychecks to. Also, censorship is bullshit. \nshe is destroying reddit\nI wouldn't like Reddit to be in charge of a person like this \nFuck Pao\nShe's ruining reddit, and has already destroyed many of my favorite subreddits. \nI am against censorship.\nI hate the direction Reddit has gone under chairman Paos leadershit\nEllen Pao's attempts to assert dominance in the workforce is disgusting and her past will never be forgotten. You lost the trial, your views are incorrect and your mind is a shambles.\nEllen does not have Reddit's best interest in mind and is ruining the site. She is not fit for the job.\nDown with pao!\nEllen Pao needs to go, she has roven time and again that she cares very little for the users and is not a decent human being either, as evidenced by her firing of an employee for having leukemia.\nEllen should step down. \nFuck Ellen Pao\nPosting broken links, deleting whale watching by accident and firing Victoria with no transparency makes it clear that she doesn't understand the community.\nim signing because this is starting suck\nReddit is turning into a shitfest of niceties and censorship \nlol @ reddit, the internet’s worst festering cesspool of would-be Dylan Roofs and Elliot Rodgers -- maybe something less terrible can rise from the ashes\nReddit is dying. \nStep down before you destroy Reddit.\nPlease leave.\nI miss the old reddit :(\nI care about reddit. I understand that Pao is trying to make reddit profitable for investors, but the way she's handling it is toxic to the reddit community. She's probably being used as a scapegoat / intermediary CEO to try unpopular strategies, and to that regard she's done a great job. Time to fire her and hire someone competent who understands what reddit is.\nI'm unsatisfied with Ms. Pao\nShe is a horrible CEO. \nReddit should always be a safe place for freedom of speech. It is no place for the censorship-happy Pao. \nReddit is being ruined, I literally no longer enjoy the site. Thanks Pao.... \nEllen Pao treats reddit like a different type of business. A business that has no place on reddit.\nShe is arrogant and a poor manager of the moderators. \nSocial persecution thugs must go.\nFuck Ellen Pao. \nThis has to stop. Ellen won't step down, she doesn't care about the opinion of others so she must be forcefully stop.\n\nIt needs to stop\nTyrant lady\nEllen pao sucks\nShe represents what's wrong with this \"new reddit\".\nEllen Pao is kill\n\nI like the reddit community and honestly it has been failing in the past eight months\nShe is messing up Reddit\nEllen Pao is a bitch, reddit is going to implode under her.  She couldn't prevent any of the recent controversies, shes a terrible person, and shes ugly.\nThe leadership of the organization has failed to maintain the spirit in which the organization was founded, and is actively subverting the spirit of its intended use. Failure to support and advance the relationship between the volunteers and the that make reddit function and the administrators is a major part of the issue. \nsweeping changes are ruining a great website.\nShe is not correct for the company's vision, focus or goals.\nCensorship is not cool bro\nI feel Ellen Pao is a poor representative for the Reddit community and should not have influence in the doings of the website\nsupport the cause\nI'm signing because I'm gay\nnothing personal, but Reddit is a strategic site in the web and should be managed by people with the best interest on the values that this page represents\nI dont want Reddit to become a corporate sinkhole that has thousands of ads and ceo's who dont care what the userbase wants.  Free speech is more important than your lawsuit.\nEllen Pao is not good for reddit. The policies that have been in effect under her are not okay.\nI think Ellen should step down.\nTreatment of shirtwascash subreddit\ngross mismanagement \nshes nuts and ruining the site\nEllen \"Chairman\" Pao is ruining the last place on the internet I truly enjoy.\nEllen Pao is clearly not the right person  to run an important company such as Reddit. Although I do feel the anti harassment policy is good, I don't support her decision of firing the head of AMA's. \nFuck Pao \npao you have been a disgrace to reddit and everything I liked on it. I heard you talking on NPR and it was nothing but lies. \nI don't appreciate people that misuse laws and their gender/ethnicity to get upper hand. We're all equals. \nReddit needs better leadership\nI truly believe she has been a key part in the destruction of a site I love so much \nShe is killing the site I love\nEllen pao is a twat\nShe is twisting reddit into the opposite of what it's creators intended \nShe helped ruined something beautiful for greed. \nPublicly and privately Ellen has presented two contrasting responses to this crisis, and has displayed a serious lack of respect for the people who make Reddit what it is. If the board truly wants to create a profitable entity out of Reddit, Ellen must leave. To quote GabeN: \"pissing off the Internet costs you a million bucks in just a couple of days). That's not stupidly greedy, that's stupidly stupid.\"\nI'm signing because, as a redditor, I would hate to see such a well established internet community get torn apart by poor leadership by CEO Ellen Pao. Clearly, she has no idea what the community wants, and has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't care. Step down as CEO, Pao! You can try to bully some people, but you can't mess with the internet!\nshe is ruining the fine community of reddit\nasian\nEllen Pao's actions reflect a neglectful and uncaring corporation that does not care about the people that work for them .\nShe has been an integral and beneficial part of the Reddit community\nThis site is an escape for me. With her careless actions for a site she doesn't even understand, she's ruining a safe haven for thousands. Single handedly, she's destroying a site that you all have built from the ground up. Don't give her that fucking power. \nI dislike censorship in any form. I think pao is damaging reddit. \nPao has had no meaningful contact with the community since restrictions began. She has not embraced the \"open\" culture of Reddit or any respect for the transparency the site is known for.  Reddit requires leadership that understands and communicates with Reddit.\nWoman needs to Go! NOW! I have already made the move to Voat.... Reddit, you want me back? Get rid of Pao, and the mentality she has brought to Reddit. Till then. I have traded the snoo for the goat.\nShame on Ellen Pao\nI believe in free speech\nThis has gone on longenough.\nFuck ellen pao\nFreedom of speech is a right. \nReddit is supposed to be a bastion of free speech. She is more worried about her public image than conducting her job correctly as the CEO of a titan of a company.\nBecause she is driving Reddit into the ground and needs to go. #Freespeech\nEllen Pao is evil, manipulative, and has no business running anything. Ever.\nI don't like the direction reddit is going \nI'm really unhappy with the direction she's taking Reddit.\nFuck Ellen Pao\nEllen Pao has overstepped her boundaries as CEO of reddit. \nI love reddit, have for the 3~4 years I've been browsing, and although I'm ok with Reddit being a little of a PR platform, the way it is heading I'm definitely opposed to. \nEh\nFor my country and my website\nBecause Ellen Pao is destroying everything reddit was supposed to be about...freedom of speech without censorship. \nEllen pao sucks ass\nI'm signing this because Ellen Pao is a incomenpetent CEO and has no business or whatsoever with Reddit\nDis bitch cray and need to be dealt with.\nPao is destroying reedit. \nmerica.\nAs adults, we don't need to be protected from other peoples opinions. Safe spaces are not needed when you can discuss topics to enable real change. \ni want to.\nellen pao doesn't believe in freedom \nPao sucks\nFreedom of Reddit, the site I love is important. USA USA USA USA!\nshe's unfair towards her employees.\nThere is no debate, people who use Reddit and enjoy this site, feel that this women shouldn't be the CEO. Why is she the CEO? She can't relate to us.\nThis was not what Aaron Schwartz died for. \nI dont like what she has done to reddit, she is manipulative, and honestly hypocritical. Reddit has never been this bad, a new age of censorship has happened because of her. \nBecause the internet, like the world, should be free.\nFuck Ellen Pao super Sexist\nChairman Pao made me\nI believe that Mindy deYoung of Riddell Williams law firm is just as bad and may be related to her.  \nReddit is going in the wrong direction, it needs change.\nI don't believe in the censorship and thuggery of a site I've been part of for over eight years\nI'd like to see a CEO more in touch with Reddits user base.\nEllen K. Pao sucks that's why.\nI understand that reddit can be a mean place, but that is limited to certain subreddits. Reddit is a colorful site that lets interesting people meet on different levels. As of late, reddit has been losing some of its charm with their new leadership. So I am signing this petition to support the removal of Ellen K Pao. \nI liked reddit better before Pao.\nI am signing because Reddit has really gotten bad. There have been multiple instances where poor management has disrupted the site. \ni'm anti-censorship\nDis bitch, doe\nEllen Pao is a cunt\nI love Victoria\nPao is a manipulator who does not support the bill of rights and the founding purpose of reddit\nI'm an ignorant follower\nellen k pao had run reddit into the ground.  it is now a shell of its former self.  the former self of which i signed up for and thoroughly enjoyed.\nSHE A BITCH ASS NIGGA \nEllen Pao has made and let the company of Reddit make questions choices that negatively impact user experience.\nI hate that ceo or reddit . \nfuck censorship\nThe board of directors need to listen to the community, our else there will be none to advertise to.\nshe looks like a scary man\nPao is going to ruin reddit. She has no idea what the site is really about. It's more than cat pictures, it's a community.\nI use Reddit.\nThis lady needs to let reddit be! We miss victoria\nThe decision to dismiss staff so tightly associated with AMA, and to not inform the masses about the legitimate reason behind the decision undermines the idea that Reddit is for and by the users. Without us, Reddit is nothing. Conde Naste needs to understand the volatility of their domain, and be clear about the intentions of the site.\nEllen Pao makes decisions outside of the best interests of the community. \nlack of transparency.\nEllen Pao is a terrible person.\nShe has not been good to us.\nPao is mean to my friends. \nReddit is a community that opposes this woman's manipulation.\nI'm signing because sexist manipulators like Pao should never be allowed to hold power, even over a website.\nshes a cunt\nMy favorite website is going downhill\nIt's become quite clear she is absolutely out of touch with both the service her company provides, as well as the users.\nEllen Pao needs to go!\nShe is a right proper cunt.\nReddit needs free speech. This lady seems to be changing that.\nSend her home. Don't be scared of her bullshit law suit that you know she will do. \nit's the right thing to do. \nThis chick needs to go.\nI'm signing because everyone else is and I just want to fit in for once.\nBecause she is handling reddit very poorly, not trying to please and share thoughts with the community.\nBullying is not leadership.\nReddit is a community and the community wants her out. It's time.\nthis isn't what reddit is supposed to be like\nIm against CEO´s that takes something that was public and user based and change it into an private and bureaucratic enterprise. \npao must be stopped \nI'm tired of all this censorship.  \nI enjoy watching things burn.\nFDB\ni felt like it and wanna feel like part of something\nShe is a con. Bad for business!\nI'm signing this because I believe that Pao and Reddit's board members have lost touch with their consumers and user base. I don't believe that a CEO and a board who do not respect or have a passion for their product or customers belong in a company. More and more companies are going down the path of short-term profit over customer satisfaction and are becoming ever more drunk on their own hubris. This needs to stop.\nFuck that bitch. \nno censorship! Open and free \nEllen Pao, it is time for you to face the consequences of your actions. It is so ordered. \ncensorship\nPao needs to go away and hide!\nI like the reddit community as a place for people to say what they want and no be censored. With the recent subreddit closures due to unpopular opinions me and whole lot of other users agree that Reddit as a whole is going in the wrong direction with Pao being an active contributor towards that down fall\nShe needs to go\nPao needs to step down, as she knows nothing about what she is doing\nGet her out. Thanks. \nReddit needs a change \nI believe it's time for change also. \nWe don't need her to make Reddit the kids book of the internet. This is supposed to be a free website from everything!\nEllen Pao seems like a bad CEO. \nI want OUR reddit back\nI like reddit and I do not wish to see it draged through the mud because of one persons decision\nShe's a disgrace\nhttps://voat.co\nRidiculous behavior shows her credibility and character. I don't want to support Reddit if they endorse this radical behavior. \nLess reasons to sign then not to do so.\n\nHer own website wants her gone\nShe's terrible and needs to go. \nShe's ruining singlehandedly.  \nscrew ellen \nbeing the selfish bitch she is, she's running the alright place that is reddit to the ground\nI thought we defeated the Nazis decades ago.  Guess not.\nStop Ellen Pao from destroying the Reddit.com community!\nVictory had the fucking President, multiple times, actively engaging the public... Why would you get rid of her?\nShe is ruining reddit\nits gotta happen already\nshe's ugly too. \nReddit needs change!\nChairman Pao hates MURHICA and reddit! NYTIMES please quote me! \nVapid bitch ruining reddit and pushing an agenda that doesnt exist etc\nEllen Pao should resign.\nEllen pao is literally hitler\nShe will ruin a great site. \nReddit deserves better management\nEllen Pao is ruining any fun I managed to squeeze out of Reddit and destroying a community\nI can't believe a manipulative, arrogant woman like Ellen Pao is in charge of the community I love, and actively ruining it.\nI'm signing because censorship has no place in a website as influential as reddit.\nI have no confidence in Pao's leadership.\nshes a cunt\nI felt like the whole idea about Reddit was voted on by the users.. not some corporate decision making nonsense.  The idea that Pao thinks she can speak for the majority of us really gets me to the core.   I want her out.\nPao gotta go! I will boycott Reddit until she is gone\nI'm signing because Ellen Pao is a walking parasite who is not apologetic to the very community she is ultimately in charge of. Reddit Inc needs to hire a CEO who at least reads the website they're in charge of. Ellen may be able to read, but she severely lacks the brain cells and synapses to understand any of it. \nHer leadership has slowly caused the quality of the site to decrease. \nCensorship is wrong.\nShe's horrible.\ni do not like the direction the company is being taken with Pao in leadership \nShe needs to go\nFreedom on speech and expression should not be censored of banned by arbitrary decisions.\nEllen pao is quickly ruining an amazing site and community. She needs to step down.\nReddit was a shining beacon of free speech. Pao must leave. Everyone leaving Reddit is not the solution,  removing Pao is. \nIn the last months, I have seen a lot of censorship and upset users. Reddit seems to be on the decline from a user only standpoint. \nHer recent decisions \nIt's pao. Nuff said\nReddit should be a vehicle for free speech and free thought.\nEllen Pao has proven to be disconnected from Reddit's user base and the free-and-open communicative spirit of the site; she has demonstrated no intention to work in the best interests of Reddit's content creators and curators.\nI loved reddit the way it was and hate to see politics ruin a good thing.\nI love reddit and I hate watching it slowly turn into the monstrosity that it has become today.\nSupport freedom of speech\nshe is ruining the foundation on which reddit was built. \nMs Pao's arrogance is staggering. \nBecause Pao is a cunt faced whore\nBlah blah blah ELLEN PAO IS LITERALLY HITLER blah blah blah\nPao is not acting in the best interest of reddit. Her past has also shown her not as a leader but as a self implied victim making her incapable of effectively managing reddit as one of the most visited Web site in the world. Her actions have lead reddit, a free speech platform to fall from being one of the most visited websites in the world. \nI want reddit back the way it used to be: a collective uncensored(mostly) people.\nEllen Pao has proven a dangerous liability to the Reddit community, not to mention her and her husband have committed large scale criminal fraud. While there are problems that are inherent within Reddit as a structure, her removal is quintessential to the site's health and longevity.\nreddit needs to sort its shit out. Reddit is a community and we dont want corporates to ruin it.\nLack of transparency in the various operations of Reddit\nI do not like the changes that are being made to reddit\nShe needs to step down so someone more in touch with the community and its need can take over.\nWrong is wrong....\nI have never seen Reddit in the state it has been in since Pao became CEO. It is clear to me that a change is needed.\nShe has shown herself to be incompetent about the product and apathetic about the users that make reddit what it is. She has to go.\nI don't think she's helping to cultivate the reddit community.\nEllen Pao stands against everything Reddit was designed to be.\nCorporations need to learn that they can't tell their customer base what it likes and doesn't like. They need to listen to their customers instead of their profits.\nI get bored, if Reddit is going to hell because of her. I'm going to be ultra bored\ndoes not deserve the position\nWe need to protect le maymays top kek \nShe sucks\nEllen Pao has made reddit a far worse place, and seems to not understand the purpose that reddit should serve.  The dredging up of her manipulative past further demonstrates her inability to continue serving this company in the capacity of CEO\nBring down Ellen Pao!\nCensorship and shadowbans are ruining the community of Reddit. The website has lost sight of its core values that made it the front page of the interent.\nReddit is going to be dead soon if she remains in charge\nI don't like fascists as CEOs. \nI really believe that Ellen Pao is destroying a website that I love. Many subreddits are very dear to me, and I have found community in them as well as lifelong friends. Ellen Pao has systematically chipped away at the integrity of those subreddits, and I believe that if she continues to run Reddit then I may lose the communities that I hold dear.\nObviously, openness, truth and honesty have no value to Ellen. We need to insist that corporations no longer continue in this way\n\nKappa\nReddit was a forum for me to express my thoughts and learn from others through an open platform. Censorship has ruined my experience and severely hurt reddit's userbase.\nI am appalled at her statement that a vast majority of reddit does not care. Makes no business sense at all\nI'm signing because Ellen Pao favors censorship over free speech.\nThis woman needs to deal with the mess she is in and talk to the users of reddit. \nShe's proven to be incompetent, and is driving me away from reddit. \nReddit deserves better management.\nFreedom of speech is precioius;\nA change is needed\nI like the community reddit was and am afraid of what it is becoming.\nI'm signing because I want Reddit to remain user-focussed and censorship free.\nShe is ruining reddit!\nReddit. \nI'm signing because Ellen Pao is an poor manager.\nFree Speech thanks.\nTime and again Ellen Pao proves herself to be incompetent.  When Reddit hired her I predicted her stupidity and failure.  I was right.\nReddits going downhill\nEnough is enough, freedom of information and unrestricted flow needs to return to Reddit. \nFiring Victoria \nI don't want someone so deceiving and shady heading Reddit, Ellen must go.\nFuck Her\nCensorship is power. Power belongs to the people.\nThe new leadership of reddit, in particular Ellen Pao, have blatenly censored and generally mismanaged the site with complete disregard for the community and the wellbeing of reddit overall. her comments in response to any reddit movements or actions constantly berate the user base as either an uniformed lazy bunch of cretins or a small contingency of malicious users not indicative of the whole. that she misses the point so far and clearly has no regard or respect for the company that she is supposed to be leading is evidence alone of her failings, regardless of recent events regarding the banning of several distasteful subreddits and the firing of victoria of AMA fame. in conclusion, the recent leadership and direction of reddit is poisoning my favorite site on the internet and if nothing is done, will lead to its death in the way that DIGG went.\nNo transparency. Too much control\nI love reddit\nFuck her\nshes a cunt\nshe is a bad CEO\nIn Silicon Valley we believe in meritocracy over privilege. You have to earn your position each and every day by striving to bring more happiness to the lives of more people. The community that Ellen Pao is seeking to serve is clearly rejecting her. Ellen Pao, and people like her, don't share our values. They clearly care more about their own interests than they do about making the world a better place. They must experience the pain of losing their position in order to begin to understand the error of their ways. If this does not happen, they will never change their ways and the Ellen Pao's of the world will continue destroying great companies that so many people worked so hard to build.\nEllen Pao is a cancer and is destroying Reddit.  She has been demonstrated to be a liar, and a antagonist in open court, and is attempting to imprint her SocJus, \"Progressive\" mentality upon Reddit and the world as she sees it.  Nothing GOOD has come for Reddit since her appointment as CEO, and nothing good will.\nAyyllen lpao\nI do care. \nReddit is a place for free speech not safe speech.\nI'm annoyed.\nReddit was a cool place and it's sad to see it falling apart like this because of corporate power.\npls\nI want her gone.\nFuck censorship!\nShe's making reddit not a fun place \nI hate women. \nShe is usless\nFuck the mods\nSafe spaces are just velvet censorship and totalitariansim.\n\nSJW's destroy everything. \nI'm singing because Pao is detracting from society under the guise of social justice but only promoting her own agenda for her own gain. She is a toxic hypocrite. She constantly plays the victim while exercising malice towards others.\nThe abuse of power and glaring incompetence can no longer be tolerated\nEllen Pao is not good for reddit. She is a twat\nshe does not seem to understand the users of the site at all\nCensorship based on personal preference is stupid. That's what happened with a lot of subs. Eliminating key members of the community is also stupid. Why would somebody try to run a website they clearly cannot handle goes beyond me.\nshe's ruining Reddit completely\nI want a better Reddit.\nEllen Pao is not paying attention to those on her website who need attention. To whomever it may be said, she needs to be fired. We need more qualified, caring people-- not those ambivalent to their company. \nI'm disappointed with Ellen Pao\nEllen Pao isn't a good human being.\nFuck Ellen K. Pao #teamvictoria\nI'm signing this petition because Ellen Pao is a daft cunt \ncensorship \nshe sux\nI want to see change at Reddit\nfuck this cunt\nI dislike ellen pao\nI care about the quality of content on reddit\nReddit shouldn't allow this social justice fraud work another day.\nI don't want Reddit to fall.\nI'm signing because this poor excuse for a \"CEO\" needs to leave her position, and have someone takeover who actually cares about the users of Reddit. \nEllen Pao is radioactive, self-serving, and manipulative.\nAs a redditor for 4 years, I can safely say the websites been through a lot, but this is just ridiculous, the firings, the blackouts, the criminal CEO who's running the site into the ground. I've never in my life ever participated in ANY activism even if it affected me, I barely vote every 5 years, but this is just it, the website I have spent thousands of hours on is going down the drain and it's almost solely because of Ellen and her superiors. \n\nIf her leaving would return things to normal, which I'm sure it would help, then I'm all for her to leave.\nPao is a terrible CEO and knows nothing about the site she's supposed to lead.\nPlease don't give Reddit anymore bad light. Please go.\nEllen Pao seems to be the last person anyone wants to be doing the top job at Reddit. I simply dislike her strategies and she's proved time and again that she's not meant to be adorn the top post at any company,let alone Reddit. She needs to go. She needs a desk job. not one of a ceo. seriously! \nI don't want to have to change websites to one that is responsible and uncensored\nThe recent changes made by the reddit higher ups have destroyed reddit. \nI'm signing because Reddit is a place were great ideas grow and bad ideas die by merely the use of the opinion of its users and such auto-regulated system showed me the best links, help and fun. Since Pao is CEO it looks like this site is loosing all for what it stands and the great posibility that it monetizes even more than any existing big portal. \nAnyhbody who censors Reddit must go.\nI want Reddit to exist uncensored and community driven, the essential idea behind reddit.  Else, we'll all abandon just like Digg.  Doubt us?  try it...  Ellen is not the right person to run this company.\nI do not condone the way she is running the website, Reddit. She is constricting free speech, firing the most important admins and using Reddit as her personal ATM after loosing her law suit. It is time we get a worthy CEO, who can run the once greatest website on the internet. Now, if Pao remains CEO, Reddit will crumple. It is time to give Reddit to someone who can truly run a company.\nThe Titanic could have used a warning. Reddit's ignoring theirs.\nShe sucks AIDS infested donkey dick\nI want the old reddit and for Victoria!\nIt's supposed to be a place for free speech, not just the free speech she tolerates.\n\nYes some went on raids and were disrespectful but ban them not the sub they were from. There is a reason for collective punishment being illegal in some countries... \nEllen pao is a nazi\nWhile I have mixed feelings about the removal of those hateful subreddits - I do not believe she is fit to to be the C.E.O - yes, you are expected to make tough decisions, yet are unable to provide enough transparency for a social media site that is literally run by thousands of volunteers. Being unable (unwilling more so it seems) to provide fundamental, essential communication with a community driven website, is asking all your volunteers to transfer over their trust from someone who is well established, trusted and then told, \"no, you don't need to know why we let that person go.\"\n\nEllen Pao would be naive to think she hasn't done major damage to the reddit infrastructure and community base. \nI don't trust Ellen. \nI WANT REDDIT BACK TO NORMAL PLEASE!!!\nI dont like the direction reddit is going with pao and the recent events crossed the line.\nThe level of censorship is obscene and her leadership style is not beneficial for a site of this size and magnitude  \nEllen Pao should step down\nShe is getting rid of vital parts of reddit\nfuck the king\nI'm signing because Ellen Pao will destroy Reddit.\nI disagree with her way of running things.\nEllen Pao is DESTROYING Reddit. \nClearly the leadership at Reddit, underneath Ellen Pao, has failed at connecting with its user base and volunteer moderators in a way that is conducive to positive communication.\nI believe reddit should be a free speech platform, not an advertising platform or a \"only free speech if we approve of your speech\" platform.\nShe doesn't seem to be good at things in general.\nShe's ruining Reddit and doest represent the founders vision of what reddit is supposed to be.\nI'm signing because Ellen Pao is a dumb bitch who can't do her job right.\nIf any CEO is this out of touch with their customers, then the CEO and Company need to change their approach and their leadership.\nBecause she is a piece of shit\nHer actions and personal behavior are not in line with the community I signed up for.\nEllen Pao promotes censorship. A very dangerous thing. \nEllen Pao has made changes that are not for the benefit of the users, but for the benefit of herself.\nPao's tenure has not brought any improvement to relations between the administrative team and the community. The current CEO and admins continue to make decisions with little regard to the community, and such a trend will ultimately cause the community, and the company, to collapse. I see no reason to keep confidence in the current CEO.\nShe's bad\nFuck pao ayy lmao\nKunn Pao\nI believe Ellen Pao is doing more harm than good\nEllen Pao is running reddit into the ground.\nI like reddit\nI'm signing because I believe a proper CEO should conduct him or herself in a completely different manner. Ellen Pao has dismissed the users of Reddit and will take Reddit to the ground. \nthis foul creature will destroy reddit. \nI don't know, I just want Reddit to shut up about this\nBecause I believe she is not right for the job. She's not actually benefited reddit in any way so far, and has hurt it quite a bit. She needs to leave before she destroys reddit.\nI'm signing because it is a typical dumb CEO figurehead that does not understand its own product.  Also, censorship is bad for everyone.  This is the US, we don't censor...we do not ban bad opinions.  It starts with banning \"harrassing subs\" but it really is something you don't agree with.  Shame!! \nI am tired of the reddit governing bodies altering what makes the site great. The removal of Pao is a message that the site should be unaltered. \nFuck pao\nasdasd\nDis sum bullshit!\nI'd like a CEO who is more involved with a website that thrives because of it's community.  \nEllen Pao is destroying something big and needs to stop while the chance is there\nEllen Pao doesn't even know what reddit is. She is just in it for the money and doesn't care for the community at all!\nWe need someone who cares about free speech. \nI moderate r/pizza. 7 years of quality food, very little drama. I cannot forsee a Reddit where the admins control our communities, covertly advertise, and censor a user driven network. \nRow row fight the pao\nEllen pap is ruining a once great site\nI support a positive reddit, not a negative one...\nfuck pao stupid whore bitch cunt\nYou are the worse CEO ever.\nEllen Pao is a cunt and needs to go.  No apologies, no backtracking, no discussion.  I've logged off reddit and only gone back on to suggest she leave and I will not go back until she is gone\nReddit is my favorite website and I don't like what's going on.  Victoria was doing a great job - why was she fired?  It's not fair to her or the community.\nbring back fat peaple hate!\nThe Reddit community is being ruined by this evil woman.\nshe's screwing  reddit \nFuck dat bitchhh\nno more nazis\nShe's not fulfilling her roll\nI'm against communism\nFuck her\nLeadership at Reddit is non-existent and the user's need to be heard.\nPerverting organic communities for income opportunities just isn't my bag, baby.\nThe censorship is out of hand and needs to be stopped. \nFucking censorship.\nPao has overstepped her position.\nMaybe Pao will finally understand why she didn't get the promotion.\nScrew Pao\neveryone else is\nThis should be a good test to see if \"we, the people\" can make a difference. To see if change.org makes a difference.\nPao is ruining reddit and tearing the community apart. \nI want to see how big reddit can get before someone destroys it\nLet this vile women be cursed to step on every Lego piece that has ever been made and will be made.\nShe has ruined Reddit!!!\nshe sucks\nI am signing because I have been using reddit for a while, and its AMA is awesome, I felt Victoria Taylor was doing a good job.  Ellen Pao is changing the culture of Reddit.\nBecause she actually thinks the majority of redditors aren't interested in this. Ignore her discrimination case victoria's termination but having that reaction after the largest communities of the website you run is boycotting you. If that's you're honest response then leave. Being the CEO its your highest responsibility to have and ear towards and care about what each and every redditor has to say, If you're honestly that ignorant, then then humbly admit your shortcomings and resign; before we fire you.\nPao's character is apparent with her gender discrimination lawsuit, especially after the verdict. Long time employees who loved their work at Reddit have been discharged, solidifying my opinion. I think we should discharge the face-hugger leading Reddit to an early grave.\nFuck Ellen Pao\nEllen Pao isn't a part of this community, and she doesn't represent nor serve the userbase well. I use this site because of the authenticity of the community... Pao compromises that. She needs to go.\nI'm not happy with the amount of censorship happening in Reddit\nFuck Ellen Pao\nShe ruined reddit.\nReddit needs a change in leadership\npao is dumb af\nEllen Pao has damaged reddit enough\nReddit has been a passion of mine for the last 4 years and it seems like everywhere I turn there is now bad decision after bad decision being made by Ms. Pao\nI have been redditor for six years.  Reddit is now being censored. Uncool. \nNothing more needs to be said. Someone as manipulative and corrupt as Pao should not be in charge of a site where freedom of speech and information can be spread freely.\nI'm signing because I thoroughly enjoy Reddit.com and it's content and am discouraged as a whole around its recent decline in policy standards. I do not want to stop visiting. If the CEO, Helen Pao, is the main reason for the decay, then she needs to go.\nfor the lulz\nWe can't allow Chairman Pao to manipulate the community like this.\nShe should know better. Also tell us why Victoria was fired.\nShe is ruining the one website that is supposed to be open to everybody regardless of what they want to see and it's content. Also she is negligently abusing her power. \nI liked when I never knew who was behind Reddit. They should not have so much influence on the community.\nHave been a reddit user for 7 years and like how free it has been. New leadership ruining it.\nHer choices of late are unforgivable.\nshe has no clue what her customers want or who they are. \nI like reddit\nShe's a bad CEO\nEllen Pao deserves to be removed from reddit.\nI am unhappy with the direction Reddit has taken.\nThe Reddit community is what makes the site stand out from other forums.  This lack of leadership and dismissal of the user community as a whole shows that there is an epidemic within the company and Ellen has fostered this epidemic. \nWe need more transparency on reddit. Current management is doing a terrible job. \nReddit sucks now because of her.\nellen pao has ushered in a wave of censorship and has ignored her customers since taking the lead as CEO.\nShe is delusional.\nReddit is by nature a place of conflicting values. They should all be heard, not censored. \nBecause before Ellen came, everything was OK. Then Ellen came.\nShe is responsible for so many unwanted changes\nI want the old reddit back.  \nShe is trying to monetize Reddit and destroy the community as a whole.\nI can \npunch that cunt in the cunt\nPao resign scum\nShe has to go, once you've lost the community, you've lost Reddit!\ncunt\nto stop Pao\nThis person has proved to be beyond ineffective at her job. She has gone against everything Reddit stands for and within a matter of weeks, ruined its reputation. This person is incompetent, has been suspected of illegal behavior before, and has even been described by her own employees in a negative light.\nBecause the mods and content creators deserve better. \nPao has gone too far\nKeep Reddit free!\nvictoria and the banning of fatpoeplehate\nI don't feel like the site is a free space site anymore. \nellen pao is as good at being a ceo as I am at breathing underwater\nShe doesnt care about users\nPao is an incompetent, sexist, bitch\nI though Ellen would apologize by now.... Heartless bitch\nReddit is being unruly censored and is essentially becoming oppressed by a feminist who has no idea what reddit truly is.\nI don't think she understands the customers of her website. She has not demonstrated the leadership required for a bottom-up organization.\nFuck Ellen Pao in her fucking ass!\nEUCK FLLEN\nCensorship is not what makes Reddit great, yet is the direction it's headed in right now.\nI think she is horrible for the website and needs to leave.\n1212\nshe doesn't get Reddit culture at all, needs to step aside \nCorporate greed is what is ruining this country\nBecause Ellen Pao knows nothing about how reddit functions as a community.\nIm sighning becuase i dont want the community i love's site to be ruined anymore.\nShe is ruining reddit.\nReddit is my favorite website.  Recently I've noticed a change for the worst due to the way it has been managed. \nVictoria's dismissal was unjustified.\ni hate PAI\nRegardless of the damage she has personally inflicted, the Reddit community will accept her due to a series of questionable events that she has been a party to. Events that make us uncomfortable with her at the helm of something Which holds meaning in our daily lives.\nReddit is being ruined because of her.\nI like old reddit\nEllen Pao needs to go or it will be the death of Reddit!\nI want Reddit to be like it was. Logging in everyday and hearing story after story about this is mildly infuriating. Sacking the CEO could resolve this problem for me.\nI feel it is right\nEllen Pao is a screw up.\nEllen Pao has single handedly ruined the reddit community.\nShe's harming Reddit company and name.\nEllen has too long attempted to silence the community, and any dissent is met with termination? That is not the type of person that should be running the leading board for free expression. \nReddit deserves someone better.\nshes  a bitch\nPao is destroying reddit and everything it stands (stood) for, she has to go.\nI'm signing not only because Ellen Pao is the problem, but the entirety of Reddit in general. As some have stated, Pao is a symptom of the problem, not the problem itself\nEllen Pao is not what reddit whats or needs.\nI believe Pao is only interested in furthering her own selfish agenda. She also seems delusional and incompetent.\nReddit was originally about transparency in sharing stories and discussions. Pao is not about that at all, and is in it for the money. Remove please!\nFor the future of the company\ni want the old reddit back\nEllen Pao is a cunt\nenough is enough\nFreedom of Speech \nMy favourite subreddits got banned\nShe has no idea what this community is about and has demonstrated that with her personal behaviour and her choices of what to do with the website since coming in.  \nFree speech is too important.\nPao is Mao\nReddit has and should always be a vessel for free speech\nShe must go!\nShe's done actual, visible damage to reddit.\nInept leadership and damaging the public perception of Reddit and simply reason enough to remove Pao from her position.\nFUCK TAHT CUNT\n\nShe's a terrible CEO. Bring back my FPH\nEllen Pao must be replaced as the CEO of Reddit because she clearly has no intention of running Reddit with any care towards the individuals who make it the cornucopia of information, discussion, and news it currently is. Someone who cares as much about the community as the moderators of many of the subreddits should be in charge, not a lawyer who only wants to see an increase in the company's profits. \nThings need major change.\n\nShe's destroying this community\nHer attitude towards the CEO position is not very ideal. She is only driving Reddit to the ground. \nfuck pao\n9/11 was an inside job and i'm angry about it\nI believe that Reddit is a community; it does not have a community.\nshe's doing mistakes. tons of them.\nDown with censorship!!\nCensorship is the death of knowledge. Even simple things can be the beginning of the end.\nI want Ellen OUT!\nReddit is the international waters of the internet.. N it shouldn't change\n\nShe ruined reddit\nshe sucks\nShe's going against the community and destroying what makes reddit. \nFree Speech\nBecause I actually care about my online community\nThe CEO of Reddit doesn't even understand how the company's single product works, or how it is made for them, for FREE. Most Reddit users don't care, right, but the mods and the people running those communities DO care and that's why this is going down. Get the MBAs away from these businesses that they know nothing about. \nthis retarded bitch needs to get her ugly rat face chewed off by a rabid chimp\nPao sucks. Down with SJW's!\nShe's ruining the reddit we love. She must be stopped.\nSave Reddit\nWE WANT VICTORIA BACK\nReddit community sucks now\nPao seems to be a cancer to reddit while Victoria was one of the antibodies. Letting Pao stay and cutting Victoria is a terrible decision. This can be fixed. \nPao fired Taylor with no warning!!\nEllen is killing reddit.  \nEllen Pao does not understand the fundamental culture of Reddit and has tried to change it into something completely different.\nEllen Pao is killing Reddit\nLongtime Reddit user. This insanity must stop.\nKeep Reddit free from arbitrary censorship and profiteering.\nShe's ruining Reddit and has made some really bad decisions. \nI have nothing better to do.\nEllen Pao is ruining reddit!\nYou're killing the website mang.\nI beleive Ellen Pao is destroying reddit.\nI am unhappy with the direction and the restrictions coming from the CEO.\nReddit deserves a CEO who understands and values the users and Mods of the site. \nShe should have nothing to do with reddit.\nI miss the reddit that used to exist before Kung Pao.\nI do not want Reddit to turn into a monetized ad machine and thats what its starting to look like. Also even though I do not agree and actively hate a lot of the hateful subreddits, censorship is a slippery slope and reddit is not the place for censorship. I will leave reddit immediately if it becomes one of those two things and I really dont want to have to leave.\nReddit needs a more involved and caring leader than Ellen Pao.\nEllen Pao has no idea how to run a business.\nDo I really need to give an answer? It's obvious. Band together Reddit.\nFuck her\nreddit needs to remain free like it used to be prior to Pao's arrival. I have already signed up on voat and am ready to leave reddit like I left digg for reddit.\nshes moving reddit in the wrong direction\nYou suck at CEO\nEllen pao sucks\nEllen Pao is a cunt \nEllen must go.\nWho even hired her in the first place?\nFuck Ellen Pao\nShe does not know what reddit represents. \nI'm signing because I love reddit and I don't want any entitled idiot who doesn't know anything about the site to destroy it.\nlack of character and bad motivation are leading the site down a bad path\nShe has no respect for her users.\nFuck pao\nPao is far too disconnected with the website she seems to think she runs. Her short, one sentence answers to the grievances of the reddit community are pathetic and insincere. I have no respect for her past work failures where she participated in an affair and later sued because she was a woman scorned.\nHi\nLack of communication and active support of subreddit moderators, machiavellian corporate attitude toward employees and users.\nEllen Pau is destroying reddit from the inside out. She is a cunt.\nReddit is a powerful tool that goes well beyond what is shown on the tin (default subs). It is alarming to see how well the decline of reddits quality correlates to Ellen Pao assuming responsibility as CEO. I am not comfortable with somebody like Miss Pao - who has such a terrible history in business and no experience with such a website - running one of the internets most powerful public forums. She needs to step down or 'back off' and allow Reddit to return to its true values of community instead of stupidly attempting to make it a cash cow, something redditors will obviously spot and boycott if it involves boisterous deconstruction of the websites quality. Find another company to milk dry to pay for the legal funds of your previous failure, Miss Pao. \nPao needs to go\nA community isn't built on censorship.\nPlease get rid of this manipulative, scandalous failure from the ranks of Reddit.  First she sleeps around the office, and then turns around and files suit in retaliation.  Only utter trash is capable of such a disgraceful act, and I don't want that type of person at the helm of a company I love.\nThis woman represents everything wrong with MBA culture and bad IT leadership.  Her short sited decisions and lack of respect for those that get things done day to day have already done significant damage to reddit.\nAll makt åt Tengil vår beskyddare\nShe is a horrible person.\nEllen Pao is not only out of touch with Reddit's users; she is in total denial. Time to step down, lady.\nFor the damage she has done so far on the company and the community.\nReddit will be much better without her ruining it. \nEllen Pao is not qualified to be CEO of Reddit -  the sum of her career is PC bullshit.  \nShe is making ppl :(\ni disagree with the current management of reddit \nIm signing because Ellen K. Pao is untrustworthy, and needs to be removed as the CEO of such a special company/website. \nPao is cancer\nwaee\nPao seems to be clueless about what makes the community on Reddit, how to manage key relationships, and is utterly unwilling to own up to screwing up, saying only that there have been \"miscommunications\". Be an adult, and own your screw ups.\nUnlike Ellen Pao, I care about the Reddit community. Reddit's users deserve much better than someone so tone-deaf as her.\nAyyyy Ellenpao.\nNot suited for the job\nShe just doesn't get the point of reddit, apparently.",
